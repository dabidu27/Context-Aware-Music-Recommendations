Toss her out the whip, hit her head on the curb (Sorry)

Dangerous, mood swings. Whatever the shoe brings

Now a sticky situa served with maskin tape
Go 'head, get up nigga do somethin'
Get up, go on try to move somethin'
You sick, bitch. Go 'head an quit

Y que si yo no la elegía, en un lío me metía

Y son latinas, pero bellaqueando hablan en inglés
Tú y yo, y tu prima en la misma bed
A la misma vez, y si están en los días del mes
Se lo ponen en la boca, ellas se lo quieren comer
Son sexo maniacas
Se lo puse en la hamaca, ella le mete a la mata
Y es su fuego a la lata, ah, esa cara de bellaca te delata, ah
Tú te besas con tu amiga y no eres pata, ah

Están activas las putas, la que no chiche tiene chocho ‘e cristal
Que pa' acá no venga, venga a averiguar
Este party es de loco, el que se lamba lo vamo’ a descabronar
Luigi y Ñengo con un flow anormal
Mami lubrícate, conmigo medícate, uh
Que el fantasma de la ópera te quiere en la cruz
Ponte tus gafitas clear con tu pantalón blue

¿A quién le quiere? La chica pica weed, ella prefiere
Ah, mi pastilla, mi pastilla, power, subo el level
Te busco pero, ¿dónde estás? (¿Dónde estás?)

Ella e' mi diabla, sé que nos complementamos
Entramos al club y todo' ven cómo forreamos
Otro caramelo, trago', besos y volamos
La gente muere 'e envidia si ven cómo no' miramos (Miramos)
Ella arma los porros, tiene un don pa' usar la' manos
Llegó después del show, tiró la plata y la contamos
Ella es una G, sabe lo bueno y lo malo
Moriría por mí y yo por ella
Y se tomó otra pastilla (Otra pastilla)
Sacó un blunt y prendió la varilla (La-La varilla)
Se acercó y se puso de rodilla' (De-de rodilla')

Young Money
You dig?
Yeah, Mack, I'm goin' in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair (Woo)
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cho-cho-cho-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha, you can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules, if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em, you can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill, yeah

[Verse 2]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derrière
Like smoking the thinnest air, I open the Lamborghini
Hopin' them crackers see me, like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a motherfuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit, call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch, call me on my sidekick
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to my bitch, haha
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch
So when she ask for the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch (Woo)
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass, you ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick
Yeah, my drop sick, yeah, my Glock sick
And my knot thick, I'm it

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill, yeah

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy? You knew that, chew that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour, haha
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen, sharin' showers, huh
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say, ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me
Don't you compare me 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me, but they hear me, they don't feel me, but they fear me, I'm illy

Stretch my hands to You

Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (
Stretch my hands to You
)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (
Stretch my hands to You
)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (
Father, I stretch
)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (
Stretch my hands to You
)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, ""It ain't Christ-like""

[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (
Stretch my hands to You

Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said ""That ain't Christ-like""
I said, ""Ahhh"""

On our way to Twenty Seven
Got a place on the other side of London
Doing better, doing better
And I know you left a part of you
In New York under your bed in a box
But you're doing better, doing better

[Pre-Chorus]
Life gets hard and it gets messed up
When you give so much, but it's not enough
When the high's too high and the low's too low
When you love someone and they let you go

[Chorus]
Don't you let it kill you
Even when it hurts like hell
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart
Time takes time to heal it
You can't do it by yourself
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart

[Verse 2]
It comes, it goes
We're driving down a one-way road
To something better, something better
What hurts you is gonna pass and
You'll have learnt from it when it comes back
You'll be doing better, yeah, doing better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause life gets hard and it gets messed up
When you give so much, but it's not enough
When the high's too high and the low's too low
When you love someone and they let you go

I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Cold hands, red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
I don't know what came by me

[Pre-Chorus]
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside

Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don’t talk
And if they could, they’d say

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are

The fights that keep us awake-ake-ake

I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all

And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

Кто тут подкинул напалма, двигайся, Hala Vandala!

[Куплет 1]
Делать хуйню было влом, поэтому сделал пиздато
Побереги котелок, летит мой локоть, пожелать good luck'а
Чёрный Glock, клик-клак, мой блог не за бабло, а ради блага
[Чека не check any aka] what the fuck, я ставлю тагу
Тактика закрутить зигзагом, но не сикось-накось сага
Побереги чердак, мудак, мой чёрный брат не терпит брака
Пока таймер тик-тик-так, мы индустрию ставим раком
Пока таймер тик-тик-так, мы дружно посылаем на хуй

[Припев]
Хлам — всё, что ты слышал до этого хлама
Блант, дымит да так, что кипят океаны
В хлам, танцполы рвут — децибелы, амбалы

[Куплет 2]
По проводам передал ток underdog, я андер-доктор, а
По проводам передал тебе ток, да так, чтоб твоя сука взмокла
Русский рэп у наших ног, сынок, я ставлю свой автограф
Rock-n-roll на битых стёклах, лает ствол, убитый округ
Шаг переходит на бег, на чеке шпет, на треке чека, чекай
Так пролетит мой век, по сути, кроме рэпа делать нехуй
Дай мне пару сек, чтобы остаться человеком века
Дай мне пару сек, я наскребу ещё на пару треков

Coşdurdum şəhəri, rekordu qırdım
1 neçə milyon qazandım, yanımda tonlarla pul

Cartier eynəklər, boss mənəm, üstümdə kostyum amma qalstuk yoxdu
Ayıq gəzmirəm mən, həmişə başım uçur
Canada Dry'ma bir az sirop tök
Gedirəm kosmos gəmisinin içində necə ki Bonnie və Clyde
Narahat olma balam, əmanət yanımdadı
Chanel və Birkin, qız qərar verə bilmir
Ona son model Mercedes sürprizi edirəm
Görməzdən gəlməzlik etmə, arvadvın amcığı mükafatımdır
Belindən tutub şeyimi arxasına soxuram
Daha böyük Maybach, bu elə belə orta boylu deyil
Qutan quşu kimi uçuruq
Qancıq, sən ağıllı zad deyilsən, bilirəm artislik edirsən
Saatımı reklam elədim, Sky'a baget hissələri əlavə etdim
Mahnı oxuyurmuş, ona imza attırıb bütün həyatını dəyişdirə bilərəm
Qarqara edib dikdabanlar üstündə gəzməyi öyrənməsini tapşırdım

Adderall, Birkin, təptəzə uzun daraqlar
Tək başıma sikmək istəyirəm qancığı
Amma elə bayaq qardaşıma ötürdüm onu içdiyim Sprite kimi

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Təzdən sport Bentley aldım sonra Cayenne'nin içinə tullandım
Qancığı qoydum Bentley'in önünə, şoferin tam yanına
Ala, sən bu otu Rolls Royce'da çəkə bilməzsən
Cüt köpük stəkan hələ də əlimdədir, içirəm, boşaldıram təkərlərə
Tək başıma sport maşındayam
5 yaşım olanda qapını təpikləmək məcburiyyətində qaldım
Köhnələri rəfdə saxlıyıram, 16 mərminin hamsı alov kimidir
Ciddən bezdim bu yalandan tətiyi çəkirmiş kimi davranan və osdurağa basan bu oğlanlardan
Bezdim tərzlərini mənim dostlarımdan alıb özləri yaradıbmış kimi davranmaqlarından
Həri, Cartier eynəklər, Cartier jaket, Cartier saat
Cartier sevgisidir bu, Cartier qəhbəsi
Yandan baxanda buynuza oxşuyan Cartier eynəkləri
Şahzadə kimi almazlar, Cartier olanından, həri
Cartier qəhbəsinə Cartier çanta
Wrangler sport maşını radara düşüb 200'lə
Cartier cinslər, əynimdən düşmür
Bu piyasada yıxılmağımın mümkünatı yoxdu
Yıxıla bilmərəm, oyundan çıxa bilmərəm
Ovucuma aldım arvadvın götünü və qapıya tərəf keçirdim
Çempion kimi otururam və vəd ediləni gözləyirəm
Təzə Chanel Patek'i özüm tənzimlədim
Yeni saatımla gəlirəm və heç qapını qırmıram
Yuxarı mərtəbəni çevirdim fahişəxanaya
100 minlər dəstə-dəstə, sel kimi basdıq

504 Boyz kimi bombayam, lobidən keçirəm
Zaman dilimini xatırladım sizə, 2012'dən bu yana La Flame partladır
Masamda 100 milyon amma hələ də iş qərarları verməyə davam edirəm
Evimin qabağında yolda duran maşınlarımla bank hesabımdakı milyonlar arasındakı əlaqəni düşün
Mən tək başıma 4 qapılıdayam amma bil ki bayırda 100 dənə oğlan var
Ölümünə yanımdadılar, əmin ol
Gözəl illər keçirmişəm, yorulmaq mümkün deyil
İçimdən gələnləri eləməliyəm
Hər gün Super Bowl’du mənçün, sikim içini, yaxşı sən canı
Çox yük götürdüm çiynimə
Meydandayam, Odell kimi Richard Mille qolumdadı
Qız atdı əlini donuma bananımı ovuclamaq üçün
Geri gəlib dostlarımla əlaqəyə çıxmağım lazım oldu, 13 və 0 tərzində
Balama dedim ki, ""qızım, bu remix deyil, bu Sicko’nun bir hissəsidir""
Yox, biz eyni həyatı sürmürük, eyni işləri etmirik, eyni deyilik
Ana, mən uça bilirəm, problemlərim oldu amma hamsını çıxardım səmaya
Gətirdim mələkləri, bilirəm şeytan yoxlayacaq şansını
Çox isti oldu bura, elə bil bunu Paris Hilton dedi
Biz gələndə ziyan veririk, bu bizdən aslı deyil
Afterparty, Astroworld çıxdı piyasaya
Sərdim xəritəni ortaya, amma onlar bunu anlamadı
İş başına keçəndə bilirsən Grammy'ni götürərəm, həri!"

[Verso 1: David Bisbal]
Siempre hay alguien como tú
Que te nubla la razón, pero no quiere escucharte
Siempre hay alguien como yo
Cuanto más me dicen no, más intento enamorarte
Tú me obligaste a soltarte y me tiraste al viento (oh-oh)
Yo me obligaré a olvidarte o muero en el intento

A partir de hoy, le vendaré los ojos a mi corazón
No quiero que te mire y vuelva a enamorarse
Y aunque duela extrañarte
A partir de hoy, del cuento que escribimos borraré el final
Para que nada quede de lo que juraste
Y aunque duela dejarte
Puede que mañana sea tarde, y ya no pueda olvidarte

[Post-Coro: Sebastián Yatra, David Bisbal]
Aunque me duela olvidarte, sé que voy a dejarte
A partir de hoy, a partir de hoy
Aunque me duela olvidarte, sé que voy a dejarte

Mi vida entera te prometo que a partir de hoy
Voy a alejarme y no escribirte como un perdedor
Al fin y al cabo ya no hay nada que contarte
Yo ya di mi parte y aún así no volverás
Y aunque sea difícil ya no verte más
Será por mi bien no saber dónde estás
Yo para tus juegos ya no estoy
A otros brazos yo me voy porque-

We in the war zone where the war's on, where ya gun, nigga?
Show 'em where you're from, nigga, ridin'-ass young nigga
Arsenal equipped, hot enough to scorch
With the double fours on the hip rollin' with the force
He's out to catch a body
Talkin' 'bout ""I thought this was a gangsta party""
Now he's walkin' around salty as the sea
Talkin' 'bout ""What's jumpin'?""
I'm 'bout to get the pump to pumpin' and start dumpin' on somethin'

[Chorus: Mack 10 | Kurupt | Daz Dillinger | Mack 10 & Kurupt]
Fuck you over there, party over here
And if you wanna trip, we got the straps near
'Cause niggas like us do platinum every year
And if I ruled this sphere
, 
your shit'd disappear
Now everybody in the house, throw your dubs in the air
And wave 'em all around like ya just don't care
It's worldwide and dope, so, nigga, act like ya savvy
Mack 10 and Tha Pound cookin' nothin' but the cavi

[Verse 4: Mack 10]
I'm servin' niggas like a host with the pound, so take a toast
Dog, this West Coast and our shit bump the most (Westside)
'Cause vine to vine I swing through the woods of Ingle
And everything I make, fuck around and be a single
From the hoo-bangin' hits, to the yes, yes, y'alls
Now all down my halls, got plaques on my walls
We might slow the roll, sit back and still kick it
But the shit don't stop 'til we hit a meal ticket

[Verse 5: Daz Dillinger]
I'll be goddamned, I'm in it for a meal ticket
And the goal's successful I don't know who to prove a show
Usual swerve a corner, hit a block back-to-back
I don't know, it's like that, where the gangbangers hang at
They say, ""Daz, you a rider?""
I reply with, ""Boy, hell yeah, I'm a rider!""
From the Eastside of Long Beach to the Westside of Inglewood
On a cash mission bailin' hood to hood

[Verse 6: Kurupt]
Once upon a time in the early stages of my life
Sacrifice, out for the loot shaking niggas like dice
Forever and a day, say what you say
On the mic I display, Philly to LA
I've been all over from Crenshaw and Imperial
To 108th, I'm sure Mack got my back
It's all about mashin', cash and heat in the stash
When you're with a neighborhood of assassins
What you say?

[Chorus: Mack 10 | Kurupt | Daz Dillinger | Mack 10 & Kurupt]
Fuck you over there, party over here
And if you wanna trip, we got the straps near

L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

[Break: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
Beautiful people

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran, Both, Khalid]
That's not who we are (we are, we are not)
We are not beautiful, yeah (not beautiful, beautiful)
Yeah, that's not who we are (we are, we are not)

Don't change, I like the way you make me feel
Can we take our time and do this for a while?

Born up in tha city of tha O.A.K.L.A.N.D
Ghetto-bound hustla, no sucka, serious about my bussiness

Whatever a nigga go fo, he gots me on tha double

Niggas who be riggas, but I'm a go and hit and do a diggum smack
And take to yo' ass back to tha future

With a waffle from Roscoe's, our mission
Is never impossible. Not fo me see, so fuck that old series, you stuck

Hoy me corre sol y arena, dos mami' bien buenas
Whisky con cojone', la música que suena
Sabe a party piscina con la hija 'e la vecina
Bebiendo to' el corrillo y smokiando en una esquina (¡Rey!)
Un pote 'e picosina y un buche 'e gasolina
Volumen pa' la bocina, coro y vamo' pa' encima
Hoy nos fuimo' al garete aunque llamen la policía
Activa'os los mozalbete', que la calle está prendía (¡Don, Don!)
Shorty anda encendía, corriendo por la mía
Modelando en la orilla con su copa prendía
Coqueta lucía pa' montarse en la vía
Y como yo ando prendí'o, esta noche esa es mía
Le da hasta abajo poseí'a, en dembow y brujería
El deseo la controla, esta noche hay avería
Esa baila sola si el Dj la motiva
Y como menea la cola, la muy zorra me la activa (¡El Rey!)

Prendan y corran la machina, hoy bebemo' hasta bencina
La corta va pa' arriba, Phillie y saliva
Bote, neverita, pa' la islita y birritas
Con un par de cuquita' que se quieren y me invitan
Beben, fuma y se medican, y pa'l agua brincan
Que hoy las hermanitas en G String predican
Jumbo sube el bajo, que lo solicitan
Porque las excita y al ritmo se afincan
Sirena pa' la arena, que la cosa está buena
Tiburón pa' la orilla, hoy ganamo' como sea
Sin miedo a la escuadrilla, hoy corona al más que mea
Y si alguno se guilla se lo lleva la marea
Pirata sin garata o te llenan de guata
Anda derechito o te vas sin pata'
Por ahí mansito y no nos ronque 'e plata
O te cierro el kioskito y te quedas sin gata (The Last Don!)

Empty mansion, in the rain just off the coast
Is the vibe now, that I feel inside my soul
Like a spider, there's a web that you have wove
There's a heart now, where there used to be a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
And ooh, yeah it's making me uneasy

[Chorus]
Now I hear sounds in the hallway
Rocking chairs are moving on their own
I'm falling for you
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out, out, out, out, out, out, out
Freaking me out, out, out, out

There's a silence, in the woods after it snows
That's the vibe now, of the piece inside my soul
Like a spider, there's a web that you have wove
There's a heart now, where there used to be a ghost

And ooh, yeah it's making me uneasy

Was the one thing I couldn't find

As the flames climbed into the clouds

And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)

[Verso 1]
Todo aquel que piense que la vida es desigual
Tiene que saber que no es así
Que la vida es una hermosura, hay que vivirla
Todo aquel que piense que está solo y que está mal
Tiene que saber que no es así
Que en la vida no hay nadie solo, siempre hay alguien

[Coro]
Ay, no hay que llorar (No hay que llorar)
Que la vida es un carnaval
Y es más bello vivir cantando
Oh-oh-oh, ay, no hay que llorar (No hay que llorar)
Que la vida es un carnaval
Y las penas se van cantando
Oh-oh-oh, ay, no hay que llorar (No hay que llorar)
Que la vida es un carnaval
Y es más bello vivir cantando
Oh-oh-oh, ay, no hay que llorar (No hay que llorar)
Que la vida es un carnaval
Y las penas se van cantando

[Verso 2]
Todo aquel que piense que la vida siempre es cruel
Tiene que saber que no es así
Que tan solo hay momentos malos, y todo pasa
Todo aquel que piense que esto nunca va a cambiar
Tiene que saber que no es así
Que al mal tiempo buena cara, y todo cambia

[Coro]
Ay, no hay que llorar (No hay que llorar)
Que la vida es un carnaval
Y es más bello vivir cantando
Oh-oh-oh, ay, no hay que llorar (No hay que llorar)

To search for someone
To be quiet with
Who will take me home
You go to loud places
To find someone who
Will take you higher than
I took you

Didn't I take you to
Higher places you can't reach without me?

(I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights)

I go to those places
Where we used to go
They seem so quiet now
I'm here, all alone
You go to new places
With I don't know who
And I don't know how
To follow you

I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head

-Jyodan-
I’m a thugged out
Drugged out
Ex ex boy scout
No doubt
Listenin
Grill still glistenin
Can’t sit still
Don’t do a lotta Damage
I’m a mess can you handle

Better handle wit care
Show me that you care

I’m a lot I know
I’m not a carry on

But if u checkin
Then i’ma carry on

If you ship me off
How will you get me off
Lift me up
Sticker slap then rip me off

Needa first class flight
For my fear to fly
Only way if it’s do or die
I’m too fragile x4
Better handle with care

-Chorus-
Better not drop me
I’m too fragile

-Amiide-
Heartbreaker
Love taker
Oh she cute everybody wanna date her

Imma handle with care
I hope you do the same

I’m in a flight mode
But plz pay attention
Leave me alone
Is my contradiction
Im a bipolar
With love addiction
Why don’t you text back
You know i’ll be waitin

Imma swerve when you love me
Imma surf tsunami
Cuz i can’t face it
When you leave me
I can’t take it
So better not drop me"

Yeah, bringing you another disturbing creation
From the mind of one sick animal who can't tell the difference
And gets stupified

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting my whole life for just one fuck
And all I needed was just one fuck
How can you say that you don't give a fuck?
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All I wanted was just one fuck
One tiny, little, innocent fuck
And when I feel like I'm shit out of luck
I find myself stupified, coming back again

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away

See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?

Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?

And all the people in the right wing, rock
And all the people in the underground, rock

And all the people in the projects, rock
And all la gente in the barrio, rock

When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're fakin'
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'

Todesentspannt mit der Pistole im Schrank (Knick)
Ey, bald hab' ich die Kohle für die Patronen zusamm'n
Ich bin LX, deine Frau und ich, wir wohn'n jetzt zusamm'n (Haha)
Ich will 'ne Rolex verdammt, du Pisser, hol dir ein Gramm
OG Kush im Gefäß, rauf auf die Waage stell'n
Tausch gegen bares Geld, ausverkauft, nachbestell'n
Wieder mal viel zu tun, laufe durch Bahrenfeld
Kauf' mir 'ne Dose Tee, klau' mir ein Fahrgestell

Ich vertrau' nur mir selbst
Zieh' was auf in mei'm Zelt und blas' Rauch in die Welt

Or the wave pool at Blue Bayou
And I waved, fool, as I blew by you
Hello, hi, you, I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you, feed you to Piru
I know what I'm doing, I show and prove and show improvement
And I know just to go into it, could never amount to going through it

Eu prometi o mundo pra você
Sem saber o que você ia me dar amor
Deixa eu te ter
E vamo falar do tempo que passou, dessas coisas gostosas
E toda vez que ela passa, fumaça
Embraza e vem pro meu cobertor
Ela sabe que eu sou
Dose de adrenalina, tá ligado mina
Bem melhor que esse cara aí do teu lado
Dududuh hey
Onde que essa nega vai
Onde... fala pro papi
Luzes, frames e fogo
Tudo de, tudo de ouro
E ela é meu diamante
Toda brilhante
Já lapidada, chapa, eu nem preciso esculpir

Dona do jogo, solta na noite, ela quer curtir a vida
Tá na balada, no camarote, junto com suas amigas
Joga na cara, fica me olhando, querendo beber do meu drink
Hoje vai ser no sigilo, foi reservada a melhor suíte
Elas não param de ligar, rolê com o bonde avançado
Ouvindo o WC, tomando um destilado
Pede com carinho pra fumar meu base
Depois da segunda dose ela fica 'quazy'
Ela fica  'quazy'
Depois da segunda dose ela fica  'quazy'
Ela fica  'quazy'
W!

[Verso 3: MC Kevin]
Linda, louca, doida e mimada
Dança solta, com a bunda chacoalha
Quando ela tá distraída chacoalha o meu coração
Toque do toque do asfalto, encantando a multidão
Self-service e você tá de graça
Porque já tá paga, já tá paga, yeah
O beat do WCnoBeat tocando no baile é bom
Então linda dona me misturei com ele pra te fazer essa canção

Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete

Girl you looking like a snack, don't be starving me
Wait, pardon me
You see these gyal here? They're after me
She tried lie about her surgery
I can tell it's fake breasts 'cause it's hard to squeeze
Skinny nigga but my stack weighs more than me
In the bally, you wouldn't even know me
It could've been Dave, it could've been Modie
It could've been AJ, it could've been Tracey
With the mask on the face, how you ever gonna trace me?

Floss and pause, to the point they have nothing to say
Model girls fuck with the boys so they don't ever runway
The fashion calls, so I make sure I triple my pay
Nothing's been thrown on her body but she's making it shake
I'm sorted, Knightsbridge cash or card for expense
Unapologetic in Gucci, take offense
Not here to impress, but the whip exit leave the bad B's impressed

I'm already convicted
My whole life has been turned around
I lost every job, I lost everything, every opportunity I can get
Can't get, buy cars, can't get rent, can't get none of that
But I'm still a survivor, y'know, I'm still coming to court
Still smiling, still signing autographs, but soon I'ma go crazy!
You know what I'm sayin'? And it's up to the world, y'know
America eats its babies, we, I'm
No matter what y'all think about me
I'm still your child, you know what I'm sayin'?
You can't just turn me off like that

Rolling down in Philly, this the new Iraq (Philly!)

I'm sipping Hennessy!
Riding on my muh'fuckin' enemies!
Sliding in the back, I'm screaming, ""MMG!"" (Maybach Music)
Ten bitches and they dime so it's ten I see, Hail Mary!
Put my wrist on froze, presidential is gold
Nigga play with my money, my shooters lifting his soul (Blow!)
That kick like it's soccer, bullets hitting the goal
Bitch, I'm like John Wall 'cause I just give 'em and go
Plotting on this new 7, I can picture me rolling
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I can loan, all them snitches could hold 'em
Look at the motherfuckin' wheels! Them bitches is stolen

And let it burn, I'm screaming, ""Free my nigga Hearn""
He drew with no hesitation, we can't even get a turn
Copped my Makaveli CD and I listened and I learned
Grabbed my MAC above the dresser, my OG said, ""Hold it firm""
I'm dreaming spitting with Pac (Pac!) and cyphers with B.I.G (B.I.G!)
Tried to send me upstate with the lifers and bid
Had me scraping my wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like it's a price on my head
I'm going max! Got me knocking suckers on they back
In these cells raising hell, tryna get back to the trap
But don't ever get it twisted, it's Meek Mill, we spittin' facts (Meek Milly!)

Kriminelles Umfeld – Schüsse fall'n im Dunkeln
Vom Täter keine Spur, doch einige, sie munkeln
Was Knast? Fick den Richter!
Ich mach' Batz mit Taş und hab' über Nacht fünf Mille sicher
Vermummte Gesichter, AK Trendsetter
Mit 300 km/h im Benz brettern
Was Rapper Mapper? Echte Verbrecher!
Hol' die Black & Decker Flex aus dem Keller
Angstlos zuschlagen, ich häng' mit Geldwäschern
Ganz oben, Coups planen, Banknoten, Flous stapeln
Durch die Wand in die Bank bohr'n
Geschäfte ankurbeln, was posen?
Ganz großen Batz hol'n
Ich rück' an und ihr rückt schnell auf die Rückbank
Schellen, die ernüchtern, schnell mit der Rückhand
Keine Gegner weit und breit
Scheiß' auf Hype, alles nur aus Zeitvertreib, ah

Gold in die Tasche, pack' in den Beutel die Asche
Offensives Kader, kriminelle Ader
Intensiv, Triebtäter, Beamer auf der Fahrbahn
Brecherrap, hau' Zylinder mit dem Brechi weg
Ich knack' den Safe auf, so wie Çekirdek
Blitzlicht, Gas geben, flitzen im A6
Giftiger Haze macht drei Kisten am Tag weg
Lila Scheine, weiße Steine, Reines
Es steigen wieder Preise

That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Verso 1: Remik González]
Hay mucho que maté mi sentimiento
Lo dije en una rola, pero me arrepiento
Porque no es cierto, todavía siento
Amor por el arte de este movimiento
Ando en busca de el error cada que recuento, perro
Yo al talento me aferro, que ya no ando delinqueando, es cierto
Pero el apodito santo no me quedo
Pinche evento, parece concierto
Yo no es pero, yo hago que suceda
Cuando es paro brindo más de lo que pueda
Si es de cora, nunca lo esperes de vuelta
Tengo el pensamiento roto, no hay prisa
Sé que soy veloz, por eso troto
Un saludo a cada loco que me represente
Ya saben quién soy sin ocupar que me presente
El que estuvo sabe que canto lo que me nace
Si no fue Home-run saben que robé la base
Antes locos pero locos, y hoy, logré lo que creía muy poco

No pierdo mi tiempo, me enfoco en lo bueno
Estoy concentrado, cien por ciento pleno

Estoy ensayando, pues tengo otro evento
Estoy trabajando, grabando vídeos
Ando apurado, pues tengo otro vuelo
Siempre en el vuelo y mañana otro vuelo

Estoy en la radio, shoutout para Ibero
Inteligente, fino caballero
Si te menciono te hago ganar dinero
Uy, la pelas aquí, uy, la pelas allí
Uy, si fuera por mí, uy, te mataba aquí
Pero no me interesa, paso de ese drama
Para qué hacer placa, atención no me falta
Toda mi clica, y mi mami me ama
Comiendo bien rico toda la semana

Brother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime
His sister had another one, she paid it for a lime
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em both up

And put the lime in the coconut, she called the doctor
Woke him up, said, ""Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take
I said, Doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
I said, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I said, Doctor...""

Now let me get this straight
You put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both up
Put a lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both up

Put the lime in the coconut, you such a silly woman
Put a lime in the coconut and drink 'em both together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both down
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the morning

Whoo-oo-oo-oo, ain't there nothin' you can take?
I say, whoo-oo-oo-oo, to relieve your bellyache?
You say, well, whoo-oo-oo-oo, ain't there nothing I can take?
I say, whoo-oo, to relieve your bellyache?
You say, yeah, ain't there nothin' I can take?
I say, waah waah, to relieve this bellyache?

I say, ""Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?""
I say, ""Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take?""
I say, ""Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take?""
I say, ""Doctor...""

You're such a silly woman
Put the lime in the coconut and drink them both together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the mor-or-orning

Yes, you call me in the morning
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do

Сладкий вкус, запретный плод
Куда же нас с тобой несет?

[Куплет: Тимати]
Знаешь, я раньше думал, что счастье не в деньгах
Что можно быть счастливым с любимой в шалашах
Прячась от людей, в отшельников играя
Нам не нужны были с тобой ключи от рая
Знаешь, я так боялся ломать эту систему
Был увлечен тобой, не замечал проблему
Зачем взяла ты яблоко Адама со стола?
С утра я оказался голым, привет Москва
Москва ломает приезжих (А)
Изменяет менталитет (Е)
А я родился здесь, есть же (Ву)
И завоевал авторитет
Карбоновый Aventador ночью на проспекте
Поздний рейс Грозный - Москва, мы на коннекте
Отложим сложные вопросы на конец недели
Все сложные вопросы - в Президент Отеле (Сладкий вкус)
Люди годами строят бизнес, вкладывая душу
Один неверный ход может все разрушить
В этом мире больших денег быстро сносит крышу
Либо ты, либо тебя, кишки наружу
В желудке монстра крутимся, как повезет
Покидая стадионы через черный ход
Переведи мне сумму по безналу на мой счет
Платим налоги и делаем по ярду в год (Сладкий вкус)
Отец, спасибо, ты воспитал сына
Знаю, спустя годы видишь во мне мужчину
Ты ни один свой рубль не потратил мимо
Твой сын боец по жизни, а не мажор галимый
Деньги, спорт и секс, музыка, саундтрек
Файлы по спутнику, в 21 век
Здесь чистая любовь тонет в проституции
Апартаменты в Сити, как вершина эволюции (Сладкий вкус)
Поколение X, дети - индиго
Знаю слишком много, даже как то дико
Переходя не тем дорогу, исчезают тихо
Покидают этот город в сумерках, без крика
Ты не обманешь карму - это бумеранг
36 ступеней - это Wu-Tang
Чувствуешь поддержу, значит прешь, как танк
Ставишь всё на кон и идешь ва-банк (Сладкий вкус)
У меня нет долгов и нет новых друзей
В стае волков жить веселей
Свой музыкальный лейбл очистил от чертей
Жизненный опыт научил фильтровать людей
Я до сих пор фанат своего дела (А)
Я до сих пор стелю под биты CVPELLV (А)
Я до сих пор под утро только возвращаюсь в дом
Я до сих пор один катаюсь ночью за рулем (Сладкий вкус)
Я до сих пор фанат своего дела (А)
Я до сих пор стелю под биты CVPELLV (А)
Я до сих пор под утро только возвращаюсь в дом (Брр)
Я до сих пор один катаюсь ночью за рулем (Е)

Only thing on my mind is money, money, money
For some reason she just be calling my name
I guess it's all in the game
'Cause I always run get her, she a part of me, mane
I left the studio at seven, took a three hour nap
Ten o'clock flashed, I'm right back in the trap
I been addicted to the money for more than half my life
Grew up fast, I bought a car, ain't never had a wife
Boss player type of cat, I never had a wife
I'm married to the cash, she treat her daddy right
Fuck you, what would I do if I ain't had my muscle?
I don't know, where would I go if I ain't have this hustle

Only thing on my mind is the bubble
So I can all of my niggas out the gutter
Only thing on my mind is to be the best
Number one, won't settle for anything less
Only thing on my mind is do my thing
Break bread with my team
Only thing on my mind is to stack my cash
Ball every day just like it's my last
Only thing on my mind is my kids
So they ain't gotta do the shit that I did

Do a little spring cleanin'

Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?

What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry

When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
Why I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more

That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'

See in a world when you fall and sometimes get stuck
You have to rise to the moment and pick yourself up
Be a student and learn when life gets you down
And a teacher to show others how to turn it around

And go for the top when it's yours for the climb
We can do it together if that's what it takes
But having faith in yourself makes you one of the greats

The goal is always success and we're pushing for first
But not fighting it at all never quenches the thirst
There's a hunger inside and it's screaming for change
So give it your best when you're up at the plate
Swing baby swing and aim for the sky
No one's holding you back, if you want it just fly
This is your life so make it your dream
Together we are one, forever a team

I just wanna roll with a cutie one
I ain't tryna catch no feels
We can get along sometimes
We ain't gotta be sincere
You ain't gotta laugh so small
Breathing all down my back
They ain't never had what we had
They ain't never felt like that
'Cause them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, my mind
And them summer days
Never fade away

Okay, Royalty is red hot
Shots from a redbone
Talking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones
Baby I'm just living right, and you can say I'm dead wrong
But can you disagree with that, Versace on me
Got gold on the V-neck I'm passing every G  check
Didn't fuck her for a month and never had a regret
It was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West
And we was just chill, I didn't really need sex
But really is we fucking yo
Never serious so I make everything a fucking joke
She be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke
Then we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke
See she just graduated got a new job
Took that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new Saab
Got that boyfriend that she living with and she don't smoke no more
But, yo, it's cool, I liked her when I knew her back before like

Tu voz me deja como bajo cero
Cuando le cambia el tono a ese te quiero
Me enreda, me enreda
¿Por qué jugar a quien pierde primero?
Admito que el desorden de tu pelo
Me enreda, me enreda

Espero que nunca olvides que somos mejores amigos
Y ya empezaron los rumores entre los vecinos
No quiero darte falsas ilusiones (No)
Esto es un juego, después no me llores
Y si te duele, dime de una vez no quedarán rencores (No)

[Verso 2: Yera]
Yo te pido disculpas si te enamoré (Hey)
Lo único que buscaba era calmar la sed
Que te estaba gustando y a mí también
Pero no me interesa estar con alguien (No-oh-oh), ahora mismo
Confesamos pecados los domingos
Pero vuelvo y te repito
Nada va a pasar, te juro, nada va a pasar

My spirit is with the breeze
Far from the things I used to know
Wild and free
Using the truth to let go

Serenity rests in me
Far from the things I used to know
I found the strength to let it show

I smile cause I know that it's okay
I've got this love to help me slip away
Far from all the worry that defines you
To live in truth

The truth is in love
In love there's a light
The truth is in love
There's love where it's right

Oh, ich weiß, wieso du alle Scheinwerfer jagst
Oh, weil du immer versuchst, dem Leben voraus zu sein

[Pre-Refrain]
Baby, wenn du gehst
Weißt du, ich werde auf der anderen Seite warten
Und ich weiß, es ist kalt
Aber wenn du bleibst, dann könnte ich dich nachts warm halten

Sei kein Narr für die Stadtnächte
Ich weiß, es ist cool, aber es ist nur Licht
Baby, mit dir könnte ich nie lügen
Geh nicht alle Scheinwerfer jagen

[Strophe 2]
Oh, ich konnte das Schlagen deiner Herzschmerztrommel fühlen
Oh, ich weiß nicht, ob ich träume oder ob du gegangen bist

Immer wenn du gehst
Trifft mich wie eine Kugel aus einer goldenen Pistole
Ja, ich weiß, es ist kalt
Aber wenn du bleibst, dann könnte ich dir all meine Liebe geben

When you were mine
Oh, I was feeling so good
'Cause your love lit up
This whole neighborhood
But now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city hall to the county line
And that's why I said

Oh, it seems so strange
Without you there
Things have changed

There's a blanket of gloom
Another teardrop fall
In my lonely room

Holding each other tight and we fall

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah (¡Yo!)

Ella ya se cansó de ser la victima
Ahora su corazón ya no lo lastiman
Se le acabaron las lágrimas (Ah-ah-ah)

[Coro: Rauw Alejandro & Almighty]
Ya no está pa' que le mientan
Puso su cuerpo en venta
Dice que el amor no existe
Que uno e' quien se lo inventa
Ya no está pa' que le mientan
Puso su cuerpo en venta (Oye, ella se puso pa'l dinero)
Dice que el amor no existe
Que uno es quien se lo inventa (Jajaja, y tú puesto pa' ella)

[Verso 1: Almighty]
Ella puso su cuerpo en una subasta, se volvió gimnasta
Ahora sólo está puesta pa'l que gasta (Cash)
No come carbohidratos, pero tú háblale de pasta (Jajaja)
Que ella quiere un Mercedes, no quiere un Mazda (¡Rrr!)
Aquí los cuerno' se pegan como en la' carta' a las estampa'
La ley de vida no tiene trampa' (Jamás)
Le tiran billete' que son como la lluvia, que no escampa
Le meto hasta dejarla invalida pa' que use rampa (¡Mami!)
Tú mi puta, yo tu puto
Hace su dinero porque esa es su vida, yo no le discuto (No hay cero')
El corazón es negro porque está de luto
Y si tu mujer es stripper, no la celes, no seas bruto

[Verso 2: Noriel]
(Ah; No-No-Noriel)
Ya no mezcla los sentimiento' con la mente (Ajá)
Se hizo el corazón, las teta' y los diente' (¡Wuh!)
Antes le mentían, ahora ella es la que miente (Normal)
Cuando va a salir, enrola un Phillie pa' entrar en ambiente
Ya no le vuelven a ver la cara (Ah)
El próximo que trate (Ah), ella jura que la' va a pagar cara' (¡Wuh!)
No ha podí'o nadie hasta la fecha, hasta Cupido se murió (Prr)
Porque ella misma le enterró la flecha (Jajaja)
Y ahora vive su vida hasta el límite (Ah)
No va a existir ningún hombre que la limite (Ah)
De to'as sus amiga' ahora ella es la élite (Ajá)
Porque no existe ninguna que la imite (¡Wuh!, No-No-Noriel)

[Coro: Noriel & Rauw Alejandro]
Ya no está pa' que le mientan
Puso su cuerpo en venta
Dice que el amor no existe
Que uno es quien se lo inventa
Ya no está pa' que le mientan
Puso su cuerpo en venta (Yeh)
Dice que el amor no existe
Que uno e' quien se lo inventa, yeh (Yeh)

[Verso 3: Rauw Alejandro]
Ra-Rauw
Dejó los corazone' por el placer
Ya no busca na' enserio
Déjame entrar, olvida el ayer
Aunque piense' que soy igual que ellos (¡Yah!)
Antes se pasaba mintiéndole
Ahora se pasa vengándose
Prefiere estar solita maltratándose
Que mal acompañar a otro pegándoselas (¡Yah!)
No creé en la almas gemelas (No)
No le importa si mal te queda'
No es de nadie, hace lo que quiera, yeah-yeah

[Verso 4: Myke Towers]
Ya ella, ella no e' la víctima, ahora es la victimaría (-maría)
Tiene guille de mala (Mala), como tú he visto varia' (Varia')
Le gusta hacer posicione' imaginaria' (Imaginaria')
Pero dice que estar en cuatro es la primaria (Primaria)
Y no se prostituye, pero se suelta si pagan
Y si prende no se apaga, las botellas no se acaban, baby
Y las mujere' como tú sé que son cara'
Pero la bellaquera es la que nunca nos separa
Ya no quiere mentira'
Por eso me tira y lo nuestro no expira
Y cuando tú me escriba'
Voy a estar dispuesto pa' hacer to' lo que tú diga'
Le gusta tenerme arriba

You know I'd give
You know I’d give
You know I'd give
You, you know I'd give

You’re makin' me nervous
Lookin' for my car keys and painkillers
Tropical sweat and two middle fingers
I know I shoulda ghosted at two
But I waited it out for you
I wish I knew the way things were between us
I'm packin' a bag of bad ideas
Every time I'm thinkin' of you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tryna stay cool
In the downtown weather
Wonderin’ if you think of me ever
You know how to love me better
It’s got me feelin' another level

I can’t get you off of my mind
Why do I keep wastin' my time?
Man, you make it easy for me
So why can't I make you love me, love me?

You know I'd give, you-you know I'd

[Verse 2]
You're leavin' me hangin'
So I'ma play cool when you think I wouldn't
Liquor by the pool when I know you're lookin'
While I dissect conversations
Maybe there's somethin' there for once
Ah, tryin' not to let these mind games play me
I'm down to be your casual lady
Long as I got you lovin' on me

I'm tryna stay cool

So this could be a cruel summer
Or a real lover
Tell me how you want it to go
But I don't need another issue
Don't wanna miss you
Love me or just let me go

Flagelo que mi corazón
No olvida mentira
Las tentaciones destructivas
Mentira medida

No quiero mas mentirte
Amor
Solamente me perdi
Regreso para devolverte

Amarga saliva
Sabor a culpa y agonía
Mentira divina

I can feel your destruction building up under pressure
I carry on like a ghost, but I'm addicted to a time bomb
Just another, just another hit from this eight-shot party barrel
Get the wolves and feed their souls

[Verse 2]
Can't figure out where we're meant to be
Stuck in here with a siren screaming
We try to leave
Just turn the clocks back over
Can we go back to the start once more?
Just holding on like when we were younger
That night was pure
We drove forever

I can steal that young heart
But by God, I'm on the market for a barrel of fresh blood

Give me a way home
Give me a way out, here comes dawn
I need a fucking hero
To show me a way out of this storm

[Verse 3]
I hope that one day to bring us back
From the depths, from the scars, from everything turning black
The midnight ghosts are woken
Get it back, that hunger
Get it screaming, get those bones back on the fire
Embrace thrasher

They keep coming back stronger
They keep coming back stronger
Come and attack, come and attack
Hope, faith, blind, fear, cult, set

Give me a way home
Give me a way out, here comes dawn
I need a fucking hero
To show me a way out of this storm

[Verse 3]
They started installing dread just like they knew they could
Those perfect hearts burst to flames just like they knew they would
Belief in chemicals, releasing monsters
This failing empire will suck them all to hell

[Bridge]
Darker, deeper, wiser
Stronger, unholy, corrupted
Darker, deeper
Unholy, corrupted

Give me a way home
Give me a way out, here comes dawn
I can steal that young heart

I need a fucking hero
To show me a way out of this storm

[Verse 1]
It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

[Pre-Chorus]
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

[Chorus]
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages, till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

[Chorus]
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Y el club va a estar petao', yo lo presiento
Cuando entro algunas miran con resentimiento
Porque ellas saben que ahora yo soy la del momento

En Barcelona no vamos al strip club
Pero las nenas lo movemos como J-Lo
Dile al DJ que en este party no tire rap
Porque las nenas lo que quieren es dembow

Entramos al V.I.P. y el DJ ya nos llama
Se tira una de Bad Gyal
Y yo entre el humo de la hookah

Entre el humo fue que nos fuimos
Y cuerpo con cuerpo, tú y yo unidos
No recuerdo cómo nos conocimos
Pero juntos dormimos

[Verso 2]
Al despertarnos juntos en la mañana
Nos lo hicimos otra vez aún con más ganas
Yo te dije ""Pa, no cuentes nada""
Y me fui preocupada

Si nos pasamos por tu club, no jugamos
Hasta que no nos echen de ahí no nos vamos
Y las mías te lo mueven hasta abajo
Bailan heavy que parece su trabajo

Once upon a time, not so long ago

[Verse 1]
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, ""We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot""

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

[Verse 2]
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
""Baby, it's okay
Someday""

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love

See that's my real partners
Still robbin', still mobbin'

Phil Collins, I feel it in the air
And I came from the bottom, made a killin' in a year
I feel like it can't be done if I can't do it
Had a hell of of a run, left the top like Ray Lewis
Can believe this shit, all this lean I sip
Keep the 40 on my hip, with this king sized clip
And God knows, if the feds come and pick me up
Then it ain’t no negotiatin' I’m goin' for sixty months
My partner blew trial, the game isn’t right
Told the judge to fuck himself right after they gave him life

A born gangster, father at the heart
Had a daughter at the start
So we try to hustle smart
Got a plug made the call
Call the ones you trust the most
Only the ones that can stab you
Is the ones you let close, uh
Made a toast time to pledge family first
Loyalty was a strong suit, love was his curse
He wanted his guy to prosper
But his guy want his spot
So he was playin' that part
Like he was actin' for an Oscar
Kevin Costner, the imposter
Jealous hearts conquer
But appear so strong with six shots in the revolver
Dressed up like a robber, hit for half a million dollars
Reign in the karma, click, death before dishonor

[Verse 3]
Everybody wants to know what's going down
Not with the James, not the Jim, but the Bobby Brown
Now I'm chillin’ much harder as you all know
'Cause Bobby Brown was good to— good to— good to go solo
Been on the mic for a long, long time
I'm guaranteed to bust a stupid rhyme
Now I'm on the mic and I'm rocking real fresher
Everybody out there don't talk less about me
Because I'm rocking it steady
And when I'm on the mic, don't you dare call me Freddy
'Cause I'm ready to really get paid
And if anybody steps in my way they getting slayed
My name is Brown, that's what they call me, ow, ow, ow, ow
Yes, I drive a 560 SEC
And when I'm on the mic, you gotta see me
Driving down the block 'cause I'm blocking and lock
When the sucker MC's try to drop my spot
When I'm rocking on the microphone
People gotta gotta gotta gotta leave me alone
'Cause I really don't care, really don't give a damn
My name is Bobby and not Uncle Sam

[Interlude]
Shabba-doo-wah, shabba-doo-wop-shoo-wah

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
We'll always be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that, girl

[Chorus]
Every little step I take, you will be there (Yeah)
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
(You, you'll be there)
Every little step I make, we'll be together (We will be together)

I’ve met a man, he said looking out to the sea
He said home is where you wanna be

She said I’ll have whatever you’re having
And I asked her how come we never met before?

[Intro: Capital Bra]
Ah, Bra

[Part 1: Capital Bra]
Ich hab' geseh'n, wie böse Leute fressen und gute Leute hungern
Wie Kripos Wohnung stürmen, weil Bratans Kilos bunkern
Wie Brüder Ratten werden, weil sie einfach aussagen
Wegen ein paar Jahren Haft und paar Auflagen
Kripos, die uns abfucken, Bratans müssen abpacken
Cousins aus der Heimat sitzen zweistellige Haftstrafen
Und du fragst dich, warum geht die Nutte anschaffen?
Sie will fressen, aber hat kein'n Bock auf abwaschen
Fick mal auf dein Interview, stell mir keine Fragen
Sie könn'ns nicht versteh'n, weil sie noch nie im Leben Hunger hatten
Nein, ich bin kein Blender, fick mal auf die Rapper
Weil sie sind nur die Zielgruppe der Teleshoppingsender
Und ich fliege durch die Stadt mit dem CLS 500
Schnapp' mir deinen Ticker, ich will wissen, wo er bunkert
Oh, ich ficke deine Mutter, geh beiseite, such dir Hobbys
Weil ich hab' zu tun, ich pack' die Tüten für die Zombies (Ah)

Und siehst du uns auf dem Boden mit Handschell'n (Handschell'n)

[Part 2: King Khalil]
Ich verticke meine Packs, *ch tfou* auf das Gesetz
Von uns kriegst du kein'n Respekt, nur paar Stiche aus Reflex
Dicka, wen willst du hier ficken? Ich fick' jeden, den du kennst
Dein Leben ist nicht sicher, Kugeln regnen, wenn du bellst
Bin benebelt im SL, fünfzig Dinger unterm Beifahrer
Was für Regeln? Gib dein Geld, ich bin Teilhaber
Kein Aber, Steinharter
Im Anzug von Nike, kein Prada
Rapper dissen ihre Mütter und vertragen sich, als wäre nichts
Reden mir von Ehre, aber blasen, wenn es Knete gibt
Reden von Prinzipien und Vertrau'n, doch sind verräterisch
Erscheinen nicht zum Treffpunkt, wenn es irgendwas zu klären gibt
Diese Gangstarapper – fake, ich schäme mich
King Kong Khalil, der von Grund auf dagegen ist
Wer will Stress, ich will auch
Messer rein, Messer raus, Stiche in dein'n Bauch

[Hook: Capital Bra & King Khalil]
Und siehst du uns auf dem Boden mit Handschell'n (Handschell'n)

I won't tell no lie
(All) All of the people around us they say, hey
Can they be that close, yeah, yeah
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

[Chorus]
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

[Verse 2]
Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of this world's delights
(High) High hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight
No, we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong, oh no
This is our family jewel

[Chorus]
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

[Hook]
Come on, come on, come on

[Chorus]
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
Brothers and my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing"

[Intro: Bad Bunny & JHAYCO]
(Se hace la que no me conoce
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 512)
(Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh; ¿me sigue'?)
Nunca se deja ver (Nunca se deja ver; ¡no!)
No sabe disimular (Lo sabe disimular)
Tiene lo suyo y le va bien pero de noche conmigo le gusta portarse mal (Wuh-huh!)
Llega y lo que quiere es pecar, eh (Ey)
Está puesta pa’ bellaquear, eh (La presión)
Yo no la paro, y a veces mira raro y (¡Rrra!)

[Coro: JHAYCO & Bad Bunny]
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce; no, no, no)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 512 (Como la 512)
Me la como entera y nadie se entera, un par de amiga' (Un par de amiga'; wuh-huh)
Toa’ solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga (Siga, ah-ah-ah)
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 512 (Como la 512)
Me la como entera y nadie se entera, un par de amiga' (¿Me sigue'?)
Toa' solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga (Eh)

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny]
Si las miradas mataran, la tuya me hizo el amor (Eh)
Se ve que tú estás a vapor (Duro)
Ella mata con traje y cuando se viste sport (Wuh)
Tiene el booty XL, pero usa los pantie' small
Unas pal' no aguantan presión y la tienen bloqueá’, eh
Un par de psycho, stalkea’ (Eh)
No brega en la calle, pero está backeá' (No)
La baby está muy dura, pa’ mí que está hackeá' (Eh), eh
Chiquitita pero grandota, en la uni buenas nota', eh
Niña buena, se le nota (Eh, eh), pero le explota la nota y (Eh)

[Coro: Bad Bunny & JHAYCO]
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce; no, no, no)
Pero en mi cama, se lo metí en cuatro y en toíta' las pose’ (En toíta' las pose'), eh
Me la como entera, nadie se entera, con par de amigas (Con par de amigas; wuh-huh)
Toa' solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga (Pa' que ella siga; eh, eh-eh, eh)
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce; no, no)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 512
 (
Como la 512
)
Me la como entera y nadie se entera, un par de amiga' (Duro)
Toa' solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga (Pa' que ella siga; ¿me sigue'?)

[Verso 2: J Balvin]
Me llama pa' que yo la pruebe y (Yah)
Cuando yo la toco, eso llueve ahí (-ve ahí)
Ella se vistió y yo la desvestí (Que sí)
Nunca dice: ""No"", siempre dice: ""Sí"" (Wuh)
Cuando quiere bailar, el dembow la azota (¿Qué?)
Ella se pone loca (Duro)
Ella lo que quiere es peinarse (Wuh), y arreglarse (Wuh)
Llega a la disco a soltarse (Ah)
Que si me conoce, dice ""no"", pero sabe bien que sí (Duro)
Ella lo mezcla con alcohol, como cuando yo le di
En toda' las poses, preguntan y dice ""no sé""
De contacto tiene ""José"" (Wuh, wuh), y siempre después de las 11 o 12

[Verso 3: JHAYCO]
Me tira pa' que yo la pruebe
Se pone olorosa y me gusta cómo huele (Cómo huele)
Instagram privado pa' que nadie la vele
Se puso bonita porque sabe que hoy se bebe
Va a portarse mal pa' sentirse bien (Bien)
No quería fumar pero le dio al pen (Sí)
Una Barbie, pero no busca un Ken (No)
Siempre le llego cuando dice ""ven""
Pa' portarse mal se viste bien (Bien)
Dice la verdad y a vece' miente también
Apaga las notificacione' en el cel
Ella tiene lo suyo, pero hoy quiere joder

[Pre-Coro: JHAYCO]
Y yo le di por el Expreso
Le llené el cuello de beso'
Le hice tiempo como un preso
Si la ves, no le hables de eso que

[Coro: JHAYCO & J Balvin]
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 512 (Como la 512)
Me la como entera y nadie se entera, un par de amiga' (Un par de amiga')
Toa' solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga (Siga; ah, ah, ah)
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 512

I found love on a lonely highway (2x)

I was blind, and I could not see
Somebody was blowing her horn and looking at me
She said: Pull over, I wanna talk to you
It's seems you need a friend, and I wanna be with you
She said: Can we talk about it? It looks like you're hurting
I think I've been in your shoes, tell me what you wanna do

Refrain2:
I said: Woman, you're crazy, you can't help me
I'm looking for a lover who won't ever hurt me
She said: Why do you think I pulled you over
I wanna give you my love

Refrain
Oh yes I did

I said: Maybe this is my chance to find new romance
I shouldn't act so crazy, and giving up on love
She said: Come and go with me, I'll take you there
To a better place, you'll have a better time with me
Yeah, you'll have a better time with me

Refrain2

Refrain
Oh yes I did, ooh yeah
Well, well
Sure enough
Sweet thing
Oh baby
And whohoho (2x)
Baby
Sweet thing
Sure enough

She said: Why you do you think I pulled you over
I wanna give you my love
She said: If you want it, come and get it
Come and get it (3x)
Come and get all of my love

So refrain (I don't think I understand)

You see I wasn't looking for love
I gave up a long long time ago
I didn't want it, I didn't need it (2x)
I didn't want it, need it, want it, need it
I did want love no more, no!

You see y'all, love and I... love and I...
Love and I don't get along no more
But she said: Pull over, I wanna talk to you

Y'all know, sometimes
Your heart get[s] in the way of what your mind is trying to tell 'em
You see, my mind said: Don't do it
But my heart said: Go ahead on and see what she wants
Go ahead on, it's alright
She said: Pull over
So I pulled over y'all, like a fool
Like a fool y'all
Somewhere between Jacksonville and Daytona
I pulled over like a fool, yeah
But you see y'all, I told that girl, that I really loved
Not one time, not two times, not three, not four, not five, but time again
My my my my my my my, oh!

I pulled over y'all
Now when she stepped out of the car...
When she stepped out of the car, y'all
I threw my head down
I believe I said something like (...)
I wonder can I change...
I wonder can I turn back the sands of time
You see y'all, when she stepped out of the car...
When she stepped out of the car
She was looking so good, so good
I said: Lord have mercy on me
Y'all know the rest...
Y'all know the rest of the story now
She put her arms around me, y'all
And we've been together ever since
I guess I found love..."

Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills (Yo, yo)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves (Oooohh)
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (Whoops!)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (Ah!)
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryna rap again (Oooohh)
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!
*Gunshots* I said come on, bounce!
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (Me!)
Not weed, I meant coke; dumbass, sit down! (Oh)
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out (Come on)

[Verse 2: Kuniva, Kon Artis, (Eminem)]
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid 'cause the X is gone
Yeah, I took 'em all, dawg, with some Parmesan
And I think my arm is gone — No, it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary-ass, it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Well, stop actin' stupid; you so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (Eeeh-ww!)
Yeah, I think I did too much (Huh-uh)
This substance equals cuffs (Huh-uh)
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills — (That's ill!) — Mescaline

That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They prob'lly wanna take each other
Out and date each other
Some, some, some
Somethin'... I don't know

[Verse 3: Proof & Kon Artis]
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the Hulk (Ohhhhhhh)
I wanna roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray look for dope to smoke?
No? Okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
(*Coughing*) Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a whore lady
Now I gotta strangle an {infant} (
You're crazy!
)

[Verse 4: Swift, Kon Artis (& Eminem)]
Ha, I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Hey, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack? (Haha)
We can't get jobs, 'cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack, then I might too (Uh-huh)
(Swift, chill!) I just wanna get high like you (Eeeh-ww!)
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (Huh-uh)
Speed, shrooms, down the Valiums (Huh-uh)
Even smoke weed out of vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin' back soon

I'm at a rave, lookin' like a slave
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin'
Dope-heady guy
Heroin mescaline
Pencil leads, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill (
Yeah, right

Shut yo' mouth, you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt

It come true (Let's go)

[Chorus: Juicy J]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I remember all the nights
On different corners spittin', pitchin' water (Uh)
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered (Uh)
I went to France and almost got deported (Yeah)
The fans is screaming when I hit the border (Uh)
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us (Uh)
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact (Yeah)
Get money, yeah, I do that, thought you knew that

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
Thought you knew, uh-huh

He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go (Go)
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow (Crow)
A helluva blow (Blow), from a millionaire snow (Snow)
You can waste your time, with the goody, goody two shoes (Uh)
Now I'm puttin' 'em on the spot (Uh), I give a ho the blues (Blues)
I'm touchin' on her cot (Cot), I put her on the block (Block)
You think I'm startin' over (Over), bitch, I ain't never stop (Stop)
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck 'bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck 'bout how you feel

I'm a vet' still in this game, I'm rich, bitch, like Rick James
Got a group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne

Prada store, I went HAM, my left wrist, it cost a Lam'
Your girlfriend a groupie, like Trident, she wanna chew me
Hell nah, I ain't cuffin' 'em, I'm a dog just like Snoopy
And when I leave the mall, it's sold out, erryday shoppin'
Taylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches
$100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch, pack your bags
Bitch, I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag
All I talk is money, ho, rich niggas don't lollygag

It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Gettin' money is the main reason most people wake up (Wake up)
The root of why most relationships is startin' breakups (Breakups)
While niggas get haircuts (Haircuts), and bitches do makeup (Makeup)
While we take their penitentiary chances (Huh), we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar (Dollar)
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar (Collar)
Real up in your field and, man, it make you wanna holler (Holler)
Say your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah ('Shallah)
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gon' drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain (Grain)
See, ain't a damn thing change but the weather (Weather)
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together ('Gether)

Tuve mis errores, eso me hace humano
Pero afrontarlo me hace alguien dedicado

Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the mornin'
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better than to call you mine

[Verse 1]
You need a pick me up?
I'll be there in twenty-five
I like to push my luck
So take my hand, let's take a drive
I've been livin' in the future
Hopin' I might see you sooner
I want you riding shotgun
I knew when I got one right

Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the mornin'
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better than to call you mine

[Verse 2]
I love it when you talk that nerdy shit
We're in our twenties talking thirties shit
We're making money but we're savin' it
'Cause talking shit is cheap and we talk a lot of it
You won't stay with me, I know
But you can have your way with me 'til you go
And before your kisses turn into bruises, I'm a warning

[Chorus]
Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the mornin'
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
'Cause I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid

To douse these flames

[Куплет 1: Птаха]
Тук-тук, тук-тук, колёса бьются об рельсы
Я в купе, за окном весна, уже апрель месяц
Мимо мелькают леса и поля
И вроде прошли эти мысли, что ты теперь не моя
И так далеко этот город, и я
От старых домов, переулков, потрёпанных псов
Что живут на стройке рядом
И чувство, будто кроме вас ничего не надо мне
И для меня награда: слышать голоса своих друзей
Смех, что экскурсия привела детей
Центр города, пробки, районы, пальцы ловкие
Стаи птиц вольных
Яркий город с хмурыми облаками
Здесь живу я, мои друзья и все, кто мне важен

[Припев: Баста & Guf]
Я посвящаю строки этому городу
Его центру, каждому метру
Я посвящаю строки белой дороге на городе дорог
Спасибо центру за это!
Я посвящаю строки этому городу
Его центру, каждому метру
Я посвящаю строки белой дороге на городе дорог
Спасибо центру за это!

[Куплет 2: Slim]
Куплю билет и улечу куда-то далеко
От своего дома, может быть, надолго
На самолёте поднимусь довольно высоко
Оставляя под крылом поле аэродрома
Мне улыбнётся стюардесса Аэрофлота
Ей хорошо по фигуре её синяя форма
Откинусь на сидение и закрою глаза
Я буду далеко через четыре часа
А как там без меня у пацанов под облаками?
Что суетят часами в округе центральном
По бульварам старым, не скучайте, парни
Я постараюсь, чтобы ненадолго, правда
Отзвонюсь по прилёту, сообщу погоду
И узнаю новости своего района
Ведь моя жизнь на том конце провода
С этими голосами до боли знакомыми
С раскладами ровными, с горящими окнами
В тонировке стёклами, на импортной резине
Мимо магазина на новой тачиле
Погромче включи пока стерео качает
Я заварю чаю, выйду на балкончик
В тапочках и шортах постою подольше
В тёплый вечерочек напишу пару строчек
О том, чем живут Slim, Птаха и Guf

[Припев: Баста & Guf]
Я посвящаю строки этому городу
Его центру, каждому метру
Я посвящаю строки белой дороге на городе дорог
Спасибо центру за это!
Я посвящаю строки этому городу
Его центру, каждому метру
Я посвящаю строки белой дороге на городе дорог
Спасибо центру за это!

[Куплет 3: Guf]
Странно, ни с того ни с сего парни посрывались вдруг
Один довольно высоко, у другого колёса тук-тук
Думают про подруг, думают про дружбу
А я тут: Садовое кольцо вокруг — вот, что мне нужно
Я здесь, как обычно — скромно
От Красной площади пешочком и до дома
После нормального движения в пять утра в воскресение
Мимо мавзолея, где дедушка Ленин
Мимо собора Блаженного Василия
Мимо стройки, где раньше была гостиница «Россия»
На Москворецкий мост, и я чувствую пятками
Как асфальт под ногами сменяет брусчатку
Меня обгоняют мигалки с номерами ЕКХ
Впереди «Балчуг», внизу Москва-река
Над головой ни облачка, в плеере «1000 слов»
Дома ждёт девочка, и это, походу, любовь

[Предприпев: Guf]
Я посвящаю строки этому городу
Точнее его центру, каждому метру
Я посвящаю строки этой белой дороге на городе дорог
Спасибо центру за это

[Припев: Баста & Guf]
Я посвящаю строки этому городу
Его центру, каждому метру
Я посвящаю строки белой дороге на городе дорог
Спасибо центру за это!
Я посвящаю строки этому городу
Его центру, каждому метру
Я посвящаю строки белой дороге на городе дорог
Спасибо центру за это!

Где бы я не был, когда я поднимаю глаза к небу

И знаете, что? Меня всё так радует, правда

'Bout to rip the track wit 'bout twenty-five flows
And I'm pimpin' like a mac wit' 'bout twenty-five hoes
Twenty-five five-carat diamonds in my ring
Twenty-five 12s in the trunk, got to bang
Make moves to make a quick twenty-five mill'
Come up so I can knock off big nine-nine Seville
'Bout to take me 'bout twenty-five yellowbones home
Do 'em bad and make 'em twenty-five phone home
Call daddy, tell him twenty-five got to go

I jumps up early and I yawns and stretch
Another day, another dollar, 'nother case to catch
I take my time and realize that this game is real
I got my mind on foreign, but I'm swangin' marble grill
Gots to act real bad when I close red doors
I'm shootin' spiders off my rims 'cause I'm ridin' on fours
And niggas don't understand that we be drinkin' the norm
Never trust broads, they're frauds
On the 'vard is where I slang when I claim my name
Back in the game Herschelwood, Texas regained
It's the nine-eight and I'm jumpin in the mix
Rocks up on my wrists and got haters on my list
How ya like me now? 'Cause I'm real
Comin' down piece and chain four shiny grills
Gots to bring hat, where them boys at?
Fixin' to break the mic down, it's that Fat Pat

I'm so throwed in the game
Southside playas, screwed up click mayne
Wit the Botany set you can bet them smoove as a 'vette
Comin' through this motherfucker man, hold up it's lit
Some niggas catch me high like that
And some niggas act like they wanna pull a gat
But they betta watch out for the boy P-A-T
Ask them motherfuckin' haters can they handle me
'Cause I be so throwed in this game
Comin' down on the swang
Grip wood grain, on the shirt I leave a stain
'Cause you tryna jack a real true G
Comin' down the boulevard, can ya see me
Swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop my trunk and yep yep yep
Niggas betta see a nigga roll
Starched down and I'm rollin on 84s
It's the nigga F-A-T represent the clique
Right up in the bowl and a whole lotta shit
You betta look around 'cause they don't understand it
I'ma say, ""Hold up!"" and scream, ""God dammit!""
'Cause I'ma let the gat gone grip and gone take a trip
And if it's empty clip just throw it off the ship
'Cause it's a throwaway gat
It's that Fat Pat, where them haters at, where them haters at
Man love it man

[Intro]
Ye ye ye
Irama

[Strofa 1]
Sono stato troppo crudo
Come un taglio con il sale
Ma la voglia che ho di prenderti e di farti mia non mi fa ragionare
E mi hai detto: ""Con me hai chiuso""
Sono stanco di aspettare
Ma se la bocca è fatta per tradire, il cuore per restare

[Ritornello]
E sono un arrogante
E non mi importa se non sei più dalla mia parte
Non è importante
E sono un arrogante
Tutte le volte che eri qui e ti ho messa da parte
Non è importante
Balla lentamente, oh, eh-oh
Senza dire niente, oh, eh-oh
Con la faccia al sole
La tua pelle che sa di sale, oh, eh-oh
Fallo lentamente, oh, eh-oh
Come fossimo io il giorno, tu la notte
Tu viso pulito, il mio pieno di botte
Io e te

[Strofa 2]
Come un cabaret
Sembri un cabaret e tu
Sembra quasi che non vuoi scherzare
Io sopra di te, uh
Tu sopra di me, tu
Calma, calma
Ehi, come Monnalisa ma con la mia camicia
Mi ricordo la tua amica, sembra una calamita
Ora allaccia la cintura che entriamo nella mia vita
Ti riporto a casa dopo che ti ho servita
Dai, vieni più vicino, sì, muovi quel bacino
La mano tra i capelli, sì, ancora, ancora
Dai, vieni più vicino, sul collo tuo respiro
La mano tra i capelli, ma l'altra dove va?
E lo so, la bocca è per tradire ma il cuore no (Andiamo, andiamo)

[Ritornello]
E sono un arrogante
E non mi importa se non sei più dalla mia parte
Non è importante
E sono un arrogante
Tutte le volte che eri qui e ti ho messa da parte
Non è importante
Balla lentamente, oh, eoh
Senza dire niente, oh, eoh
Con la faccia al sole
La tua pelle che sa di sale, oh, eoh
Fallo lentamente, oh, eoh
Come fossimo io il giorno, tu la notte
Tu viso pulito, il mio pieno di botte
Io e te

[Interludio]
Ora ho capito per te
Che sei importante

[Pre-Ritornello]
E sono un arrogante
E non mi importa se non sei più dalla mia parte

[Ritornello]
Non è importante
E sono un arrogante
Tutte le volte che eri qui e ti ho messa da parte
Non è importante
Balla lentamente, oh, eh-oh
Senza dire niente, oh, eh-oh

La tua pelle che sa di sale, oh, eh-oh
Fallo lentamente, oh, eh-oh

Girl, you’re a river
Of healing
I was certain that I wouldn’t last
And you are the answer
To questions
That I didn’t know my soul was asking

[Pre-Chorus]
My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you’re the brightest thing in my life

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center, you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine

[Verse 2]
I have been broken
And beaten
Yeah, the world knows how to break you down
But when pain blurs my vision
I won't worry
Because you always turn it back around

[Pre-Chorus]
My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center, you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center, you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time

Too good to be mine
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine

[Verso 1: Don Omar]
Me desperté
Estamos borracho y frente a la arena
Y tropecé con dos tacones y aquellas botellas
Voy recordando
La rumba que hice estuvo buena
Y me encontré en amores como una sirena

[Pre-Coro: Wisin]
¿Pa’ qué seguir trabajando?
Yo sigo celebrando
Así la vida se vive mejor
Anoche fue una locura
Mañana es otra aventura
Quizás pasado me olvide de hoy
¿Pa’ qué seguir trabajando?

Anoche fue una locura
Mañana es otra aventura

Yo no necesito vacaciones
Ni dolores de cabeza
Solo me bastan mis amigos
Y un traguito de cerveza
Yo no necesito vacaciones
Ni dolores de cabeza
Sólo quiero que me avisen
Si esta noche hay una fiesta

Lelo lero lai, sudando
Lelo lero lai, guayando
Lelo lero lai, perreando
Lelo lero lai, vacilando
Lelo lero lai, sudando
Lelo lero lai, guayando
Lelo lero lai, perreando
Lelo lero lai, vacilando

[Verso 2: Lennox]
Ay, yo quiero vacilar
Tráete a la vecina que subió la adrenalina
Y hoy la vamos a formar
Mi gente está disfrutando
Las botellas siguen llegando
¿Pa' qué vacacionar?
Si con las nenas bien yo la estoy pasando, uh oh

[Coro: Zion, Wisin]
Yo no necesito vacaciones
Ni dolores de cabeza
Solo me bastan mis amigos
Y un traguito de cerveza
Yo no necesito vacaciones
Ni dolores de cabeza
Sólo quiero que me avisen

Lelo lero lai, guayando
Lelo lero lai, perreando
Lelo lero lai, vacilando
Lelo lero lai, sudando
Lelo lero lai, guayando
Lelo lero lai, perreando
Lelo lero lai, vacilando

[Verso 3: Wisin]
Me levanté de la cama y la rumba me llama
24/7 en busca de una dama
Se me olvida la fama y el trago se derrama
Y sigo guayando y bailando hasta que los pies se me inflaman
Yo sé que tú quieres, yo también quiero
No pongo, pero quiero ser el primero
Si me pides un beso, lo exagero
Tú sabes, el vaquero
El que anda con la cubana y el sombrero

[Puente: Zion]
Ahora es que tú te mueves solita, tu cuerpo lo necesita
Ahora es ponte una mano en la cadera
Y en la otra, otra cervecita
¡Qué bien te ves!
No quiero vacaciones, sólo a ti mujer
No necesito más nada

[Pre-Coro: Don Omar]
¿Pa’ qué seguir trabajando?

Desde ya voy entendiendo que hay un solo lugar
Donde parten los deseos y ya quiero llegar
Y también se que ya puedo acercarte a mi
Y despacio me encamino sin el todo decir

[Pre Coro]
Cuando pienso en que tú no sabes bien
El deseo que puede ser
Yo detecto que eres de platino

[Coro]
Y así verás
Que mi verdad
También será
Esa misma verdad
Que te lleva a pasar por sufrir

[Post Coro]
Yeah, así, yeah, así
Así, así, let's do it!

[Verso 2]
Desde que nos conocimos que te puedo marcar
Con el paso que tranquila yo me quiero quedar
Porque ahora que lo pienso la verdad es así
Es difícil aceptar que hay que pasar por sufrir

[Pre Coro]
Cuando pienso en como eres tú
Y el recuerdo prende mi luz
Yo detecto que eres de platino

Y así verás
Que mi verdad
También será

Que te lleva a pasar por sufrir

Y verás
Que mi verdad
También será

I let you think that I wanted to move slowly
But now that I think about it
The truth is the only way

Long enough for the clouds to fly me away

Get back down, make yo' ass a MAC sprayer hater

""How to say no, that's the subject under discussion. And there are plenty of times in life when you have to say no. Fortunately, sometimes, it's easy! Saying it most of the times is as simple as this: 'Thanks for asking me but, no.'""

If I refused, would you take me for a coward?
Caught me cryin' in the shower, but I wasn't scared
At least not of you
You know how it feels, self-righteous and empowered

All because you can't fill the space

[Intro: Bacilos]
Me ha ido bien en la vida
Pero mal en el amor
Y decidí escribirte esta canción

[Verso 1: Alejandro González]
Oye Cupido
¿Qué fue lo que nos pasó?
Si éramos tan amigos
¿Por qué todo termino?

[Pre-Coro: Bacilos & Alejandro González]
Me compré ya la casa grande
Como dice la canción (la del millón)
Pero sigo esperando
Le hace falta un corazón

[Coro: Bacilos & Alejandro González]
Oye Cupido, solo te pido
Que no me dejes por favor en el olvido
Oye Cupido (Oye cupido), ¿por qué te has ido?
No se te olvide que tú y yo éramos amigos

[Verso 2: Bacilos & Alejandro González]
Es otro viernes frente a la tеlevisión
No tengo a nadie pa' pеlear por el control
Tu dime a mi, lo que pasó
Te hago una lista mira esta es la situación
Soy un tipo que trabaja tempranito en la mañana
Y que en clase de cocina aprendí hasta a hacer lasaña
Ya no fumo, ya no tomo
Ya aprendí a tender la cama
Y ahora pienso que es por eso que tú a mi ya no me llamas

[Coro: Alejandro González]
Oye Cupido, solo te pido (Ay de rodillas, cupido)
Que no me dejes por favor en el olvido
Oye Cupido (Oye cupido), ¿por qué te has ido?
No se te olvide que tú y yo éramos amigos

[Puente: Bacilos & Alejandro González]
Oh oh oye Cupido
Oh oh hoy yo te escribo
Pa' preguntarte, si te he ofendido
Que me has dejado en el olvido
Oh oh oye Cupido
Oh oh hoy yo te escribo
No sabes todo lo que he sufrido
Dime si es un malentendido

[Pre-Coro: Bacilos & Alejandro González]
Me compré ya la casa grande
Como dice la canción
Pero no es suficiente
Le hace falta un corazón

Oye Cupido, ¿por qué te has ido?
No se te olvide que tú y yo éramos amigos

Vacilando con Bacilos baby
Oh oh oye Cupido

En galère dès mon entrée
J’suis là pour un trafic avec des Hollandais
On cuisine le crack comme dans les grands restaus
Mon cuisto est Sri Lankais
Quand la concurrence est agressive on rend les prix attractifs
J’échangerais bien mon semi-automatique contre un emploi fictif
Chez nous le symbole de la réussite
Devenir gérant d’un bar à strip-tease
Après une grosse perquis'
Comme en temps d’guerre on recompte l’effectif
À la maison le sexe était tabou
Donc avec les bitches on est affectifs
Tu peux t’cacher nulle part, on connaît du monde
Jusque tout là-haut, des montagnes du Rif
Nouvelle cargaison, tampon Hall 13 sur la plaquette
Nouvelle coffrette
Le frérot est libérable, le sol va trembler
L’équipe est au complet
Bouteille de Belvé, maillot du Brésil, sourire du devil
Discussion de débile sur une bijouterie, et on se déguise
Tout l’monde en position
J’vendais déjà alors qu’j’n’étais qu’un petit embryon
Je charge une Kalach’, range ta lacrymo’
J’t’enterre dans l’désert comme les Latinos
Dans une Maserati, fluide comme Veratti
Je mène le train de vie d’un Emirati
Je fuis à l’étranger, avec une actrice
J’ai déjà casse ma puce

Détenu particulièrement signalé j’suis trop chaud
J’suis trop violent, trop violent dans le game, ouais crie Arrah
""T’es qu’une, t’es qu’une balance"" m'a dit ton poto
Je fais le yoyo, j’donne à manger à ces rappeurs d’en bas
J’suis solo, j’ai qu’une place dans la Ferrari
Elles montent à deux côté passager à la heneni
On me soupçonne d’être un dealer
Tu rentres pour des délits mineurs
J’ai la SACEM de ""Thriller"", oh oui c’est la vie
J’dors pas si j’ai pas mon spliff de canna’
À quoi sert d’avoir une femme si ton shit elle rentre pas ?
J’fais du bruit, Akrapovič j’entends le go
J’vais te fumer, donne-moi la rançon
Comme t’as dit Benzema : Petit Vélo
Je mange des pâtes à la bolo’
Capo dei capi j’ai concert en Sicile
Je sors le zob, j'te sors le zob
J’ai piscine à minuit viens en trikini

Crack a window blow the indo shit I might pull out a 6 tho
Ain't no need for explanation you just what you resent for

See they couldn't blame me
You a tenner I was HD, even if they get the picture still couldn't paint me
Some kept it on safety, kept it for safety
Real all my life so they could never ever play me
Sittin' in a coupe ganja got me in my zone
Keep that shit 100 everywhere gone feel like home
See these mothafuckas love me got me feelin like I'm on
Same mothafuckas hate me got me feelin like I'm on

Slide down my pole
Shortie ass so slow
Got you boiled like whoa
One night with me
She wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no
Let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through
And tap that hole
Make it lose control
All the girls know
That I hit it right at night
I'm a pro
I only come round to get sexual
And she flexible
And I'm sexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that murk that work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine

Olha só, eu derrapei, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, olha só, eu derrapei
Eu acelero, mas não paro, quanto mais eu faço hit eu acelero, mas não paro
Ela quer fuder no carro, cinco hora no trabalho pra depois fuder no carro
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
No meu slick eu tô levando uma peça
E olha pra essa bitch, tem pressa
Taco o pau nessa puta sem pressa
Com meu Nike eu me sinto tão fly
Bad bitch tenho na line (Sauce, sauce)
Ela quer saber o que eu porto no slick (Woo, hoo)
Se eu te conto isso é thug demais
Pode vir sua amiga, pode vir sua prima
Po-po-pode, tá suave demais
'Cê pode ser rico, pode ter uns amigo
Que se nós te pega vai ser pow, pow, pow, pow

Yeah, yeah, bitch vem de lace

Pele, muito Gucci na minha pele
Ele, muito ouro na minha pele
Ela, pego ela pelo menos
Pera, ela quer pegar no pênis
Jogo essa cadela no meu pet shop (Pet shop)
Lambo tá vermelha tipo ketchup (Ketchup)
Disse que é vermelho, minha Lamborghini (Lamborghini)
Lotto com Nagalli, não é Metro
Fodo com essa bitch na cabine
Ela tá com fogo tipo chili
Pego esse pacote lá do Chile (Lá do Chile)
Fumo droga nessa Mitsubishi (Alright)

Acho que essa bolsa é marca Louis
Acho que essa bitch quer minha Louis

Meu drip eles querem ter, mas nunca vão ter porque eu não comprei
Moquei vários flagrante nessa Double C' e dei pra minha bae'
Eu pego no preço certo porque esse crack eu que fabriquei
Eu fecho pelo correto e esse pé de breque não tá na gang
Meu jeans, olha só meu jeans, tenho umas Supreme e também umas Bape
Meu fim é longe daqui, eu tô bem tranqui', eu nem comecei

Ahn, ó

Do outro só puta maluca fazendo de tudo pra sentar no pau (Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow)
Na frente uns filha da puta querendo meu erro pra vim me matar (Aham)
No meu colo tem uma gostosa que os cara da frente queria pegar
Bitch joga memo essa bunda pra eles
Faz eles ficar mordido de tanta raiva
E pega gostoso memo' no meu macete
Se tiver gostoso lambe o cano da arma
Faz eles pensar que 'cê tá só de gracinha
Bato na sua bunda e 'cê faz cara de dor
Acho que deu certo, já tá vindo algum deles
Pega minha Glock que o tempo fechou
Bem que um dia o Igu falou
Que se eu pudesse escolher uma fiel
E eu falei pra ele que eu vou trabalhar nisso
Que o meu escritório tava sendo um bordel
Gosto de stripper que tem a bunda grande
Tipo aquelas preta que nós viu na Royal
Yeah, pega um remedinho daqueles
Que a noite delas vai se acabar no pau

I fell in love with the chemicals
I used to pray for a miracle, but now
I know that it's all over
We used to sit by the waterside
I'd kiss your cheek and say, ""You're mine""
But now I know it's over

[Pre-Chorus]
And all these little things, they start to slip away, hmm
And all these little things, they start to fade away
And you said

[Chorus]
""Hold me, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'm scared and lost in the dark
And this feeling surely cannot last""
So I took it away, I took it away
Away from you
Mmm, woah, woah

[Verse 2]
I held your hand but you let it go
And I knew your heart had found a home
And now I know it's over
I flew it out into the sky
Was tryna run from this mountain I couldn't climb
'Cause I knew I'd fall over

[Pre-Chorus]
And all these little things, they start to slip away, hmm
And all these little things, they start to fade away
And you said

[Chorus]
""Hold me, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'm scared and lost in the dark
And this feeling surely cannot last""
So I took it away, I took it away

[Bridge]
We were making plans and breaking dreams
When you were next to me
It's 3AM in the back of a cab
And I am begging on my knees
Don't go, won't you stay?
I can't stand to watch you walk away from me
And you said

[Chorus]
""Hold me, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'm scared and lost in the dark
And this feeling surely cannot last""
So I took it away, I took it away
Away from you

[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
We came here to party, we came here to dance
You know that you're my girl, damn right I'm your man
This night going too good, don't fall for the games
Or the he said, she said dumb shit

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers
But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you
Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under
But I know what this could be
Tearing up my history for you

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got, I got, I got, I got options
You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem
Can I get some of your love?

So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Been around the game, been around the fame
Been around the money, been around some names
But the chico's still the same, some things never change
Here's a tip, show me your friends
I'll show you your future, keep the change
I've seen 'em come and go, I've seen 'em sell they souls
You my number one draft pick, baby, let's pick and roll
I always keep you up, up on a pedestal
Misery loves company, baby, don't sweat these hoes

They looking for the perfect man
They looking for the perfect life
They take some perfect pics
They want some perfect dick
But there ain't nothing perfect, girl
No such thing as a perfect world
These broads try hard to be
Who they not and not who they are
Baby, you sweating what? Baby, you sweating who?
You talking 'bout such and such who tries to be you?
Man, you JFK, mami, you out your mind
Misery loves company, I'll tell you one more time

Yo me acuerdo de ti
Lo que un día tú y yo fuimos
Ella brincando encima de mí
Casi to' lo’ problemas resolvimos
Pero todo llega a su final
Lo que empezamos, no pudimos terminar
Nos odiamos, pero nos buscamos pa' chingar
Mami, eres tú, mi perfecto mal

[Coro: Rauw Alejandro, Kevin Roldán]
La próxima salida es pa' tu casa
Respóndeme, baby, si debo cogerla
Sé que de nuestro amor ya no queda nada
Sólo que mi cuerpo sabe que el tuyo está cerca

Dime si nos podemos ver, nos podemos ver
Aunque sea una última vez
Dime si lo quieres hacer, lo quieres hacer
Como antes, de espalda en la pared (Kevin Roldán)

[Verso 1: Kevin Roldán]
Cuando te devoraba contra la pared (Contra la pared)
Te encanta, chorreabas, bebé (Jeje)
Tú echada encima mia otra vez (Sí)
Soplando tusi, bebiendo Moët
Me dijeron que te sentis sola
Que desde que te dí, ninguno te enamora (Ajá)
Que sólo conmigo le mete hasta el cora’
Y que te mojas cuando sueno en la emisora (KR, uh)
Welcome, welcome, bienvenido a mi mansión
Te beso por el cuello y pal' la'o ese calzón
Fumando kush, dándome un par de cacha
Mueve ese culo como lo mueve en Snapchat (Ah)
Dale pa' atrás, 'tás con el rey, Kevin Roldán
Dándote acapella como tú lo quieras, te la como entera
Sé que duele, pero no voy a parar, ah
Fumando kush-kush, dos cachas
Mueve ese culo como lo mueve en Snapchat

La próxima salida es pa' tu casa
Respóndeme, baby, si debo cogerla
Sé que de nuestro amor ya no queda nada
Sólo que mi cuerpo sabe que el tuyo está cerca

Dime si nos podemos ver, nos podemos ver

Dime si lo quieres hacer, lo quieres hacer

[Verso 2: Khea]
Dime si lo quieres hacer y si puede ser (Eh-eh, eh-eh)
Completa te quiero comer, a ver dame tu cel
Mientras lo hacemo', tú me pides que no pare (Pare-pare)
Por ese culo, baby, tumbo mis rivales (-vale', -vale’)
Baby, lo que tú quiera’ hacer, lo podemo' hacer (Eh-eh)
Completa te quiero comer y lo sabes bien
Mientras lo hacemo’, tú me pides que no pare (Pare-pare)
Por ese culo, baby, tumbo mis rivales
Me llama pa' que le dé, siempre lo hace así
Si se pasan las tres y media, está aquí
Yo soy su Joker y ella mi Harley Quinn
Ella no está operá', vive metida en el gym, yeah
La próxima salida es pa' tu casa
Respóndeme, dime si debo cogerla
Tu novio, a ti te tiene en amenaza
Si te toca, yo le declaro la guerra

La próxima salida es pa’ tu casa, bebé

[Part 1]
Im Bus hinten sitzen wie in den alten Zeiten
Ohne Fahrschein und mit dem Kontro streiten
Erwachsen war'n wir nicht, nein, wir wollten nur den Cent
Dann kam Glücksspiel und ich nahm Mutters Geld
Gezogen in die Großstadt, für was?
Jetzt ist mein Job Rapper, konzentriert, voll mit Hass
Doch die Jungs sagten immer schon: „Du schaffst das“
Ich glaubte das nicht, bis ich selbst vor den Fans saß
Das Glück ist nah, doch platzt im Sekundentakt
Kein Platz auf acht Quadratmeter, wie Xatar schon sagt
Jeder Tag ist schön, nur das Gitter, was dich hält
Kein Kontakt zur Außenwelt, lieber frei sein statt Geld
Mutter sagte damals schon „Mal deine Bilder fertig
Das Ziel ist nah, sei du nur zu dir selbst ehrlich“
Wie gesagt, langsam wird der Traum wahr
Diese 16 BARS machten mich in der Nacht zum Star

[Hook]
Ich warte 365 Tage
Wann kommt das Cash endlich auf meine Karte?
Wie oft stell' ich mir die Frage?
„Rennt die Zeit davon oder werd' ich lebendig begraben?“
Ich warte 365 Tage
Wann kommt das Cash endlich auf meine Karte?
Wie oft stell' ich mir die Frage?
„Rennt die Zeit davon oder werd' ich lebendig begraben?“

[Part 2]
Als ich sieben war, zogen wir nach Deutschland
Asylatenheim, es war Frankfurt, in Kelkheim
Mutter kaufte mir Schuhe für den Winter
Sie gönnte sich nix und war nur für ihr Kind da
Der erste Tag beginnt, Einschulung, deutsche Sprache
Doch sagte Mutter, dass ich damals schon 'ne Eins versprach
Doch leider liefs nicht so, Olexesh bekam die Super-Sechs
Doch heute geb' ich mir 'ne glatte Eins auf diesen Text
Gezeichnet vom Leben, ja man sieht's mir an
Entweder das große Geld, oder rein für lebenslang
Vollprogramm, Schluss mit der Probefahrt
Jetzt geht's um Eier zeigen und was ein Rapper kann
Mein Verstand ist mein Kapital, ich bau' da drauf
Leg' schon mal Geld zur Seite für Mutters Traumhaus
Doch gesagt ist es leichter als getan
Erinner' mich an früher, als wir sorglose Kinder war'n

[Hook]
Ich warte 365 Tage
Wann kommt das Cash endlich auf meine Karte?
Wie oft stell' ich mir die Frage?
„Rennt die Zeit davon oder werd' ich lebendig begraben?“
Ich warte 365 Tage
Wann kommt das Cash endlich auf meine Karte?
Wie oft stell' ich mir die Frage?
„Rennt die Zeit davon oder werd' ich lebendig begraben?“

[Part 3]
Wenn ich die Chance hätte, noch mal des gleiche Spiel
Ein Schritt zurück, lieber weniger als viel
Wie kam's zum Aufstieg? Die Jungs holten mich ins Boot
Das war meine Chance und ich schwör' dir, ich lass' nicht los
Ganz egal, was auch kommt, ich bleib' immer ich
Denk' an alte Zeiten, nicht ma' hundert Klicks
Heute läuft's andersrum, alles nimmt sein'n Lauf
Man schaut geradeaus und ackert für ein Haus, denn
Umso älter man wird, umso mehr Geld
Brauchst du hier zum Überleben, es wird Zeit, sich zu ändern
Auch bei schlechtem Wetter, lass' den Kopf bloß nicht häng'n
Schau' in den MediaMarkt, wie Fans in die Läden rennen
Ich will, dass du siehst, dass das Para dich nicht weit bringt
Und alles, was ein'n Haken hat, nicht direkt Nike ist
Warte, ich zeig's dir, lehn' dich zurück
Genieß' den Moment, dawai, hayde, viel Glück

[Hook]
Ich warte 365 Tage

[Verse 1]
I can smell a bitch nigga a mile away
Type of nigga so bitch, he should put ""bitch-made"" on his license plate (Bitch!)
From that real shit you bitch niggas play hide and seek (Bitch-ass niggas)
Me and bitch niggas, we don't conversate
Bitch niggas love saying real niggas tryna hate (Bitch-ass nigga)
But nah, nigga, I’m a real nigga, I had to bag up weight
You got fear in your heart so you cooperate (Bitch)
I can't stand how bitch niggas operate
You's a bitch (Bitch), your mama know you a bitch (Bitch)
Your girl even know you a bitch (Bitch)
I don’t know how she suck your dick, pause
You got caught with some shit (Shit)
With your best friend and your clique (Clique)
Y'all got caught hittin' a lick (Hit)
Everybody went down 'cause you snitched (Aw)

[Verse 2]
Bitch niggas always contemplate
Always contemplate what on they tryna say
Bitch nigga leave the house, think he fly today
Bitch nigga don't even know what’s ’bout to come his way, bop
Bitch nigga, you should bleed for seven days
No testosterone, you scared to catch a fade
I got in a fight and you ain't fight
You ran off, so next time I see you, I’ll knock you out on sight
(Bing, bing, bing) Ayy, I don't want no rap beef
'Cause I'm really gon’ slide, check my rap sheet (Check it, nigga)
Ayy, so think twice before attacking me
I'ma pull a gun out, I ain't gon' run, I ain't no athlete
(Boom-boom-boom-boom!) You count the next man's pockets
You fall, pillow talking to that bitch, she a ho, you know she our's
I hate a bitch nigga, I hate a bitch nigga, I swear to God
I don't know what's worse, bitch niggas or alcohol

Take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires and the humming wires
Well, you know you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks

[Chorus]
On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

[Verse 2]
He'll wrap you in his arms and tell ya that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all of those dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
And there won't be a single thing that you can do
He's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru

[Chorus]
They're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand

[Verse 3]
You don't have no money? He'll get you some
If you haven't got no car, he'll get you one
You've got no self-respect, you feel like an insect
Well, don't you worry, buddy, 'cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrows
And the Bowery and the slums

[Chorus]
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
You'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems
You'll see him in your head and on the TV screen
Hey, buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru

[Chorus]
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by his red right hand"

The hustle is still in my genes
When I fell asleep, I was still in my jeans
Then I had a one gyal licking me clean
She wan' eat man like Idi Amin
What do you mean? I come for the cream
I made some mistakes that I gotta redeem
You put me in position that I don't wanna be in
We all make mistakes, I'm a human being
North Korean, Kim Jong-un when I spray the machine
You're on the other side if you ain't on my team

[Verse 1: Skepta]
You get blacklisted if you hate on my team
Fam, I say what I mean, I keep my demons close
Late night, I speak to the ghost
Get high, fell asleep in my clothes
Animal instinct, sex, money, murder, I fear nobody
Keep suttin' on me, 'cause I'm better safe than sorry
I'm a top boy like Sully with a six figure hobby
You're still on the road, better be getting that belly
Kicking off doors, better give it some welly
I came in the game, ran it like an athlete
Got a big money scheme, all my bruddas had to eat
Thought I was a scrub, sitting in the backseat
I was counting my money, making sure it's complete
They can't compete, there ain't no competition
I take what I want, you get what you were given
They calling me a rapper, man, I think I'm a magician
I didn't wanna kill 'em, but these niggas never listen

[Chorus: J Hus]

You're on the other side if you ain't on my team

[Verse 2: Skepta]
As soon as I wake up I be chasing my dreams
All we do is win and we ain't changing the teams
I still creep through the hood
Pull up on my brudda just to see if he's good
See them with the gang, they be giving me looks
See him on his ones, I can see that he's shook
Mad 'cause I made it
New whip looking like a spaceship
You looking like you're stuck inside the Matrix
I could teach you how to hustle, how to save it
When the money talks, I can translate it
I'm the go-getter
G'd up with my feet up, it's no pressure
They make threats, but they never put their hands on me, they know better
You will get pepper, hot like Coachella
You're not clever, you're coming unstuck
I was up North, I was getting 'nuff love
Back down South, tryna make a young buck
And I'll be still going when the sun comes up
(Greaze)

[Chorus: J Hus]
The hustle is still in my genes
When I fell asleep, I was still in my jeans
Then I had a one gyal licking me clean

Man, this ho, you can have her when I'm done, I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit (Trick)

But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Woo)

Your steps keep me awake

If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely

Ella jugó a darte lo que más querías
Yo jugué a creerte que nunca lo harías

Para estar confiando en tus explicaciones

Ella te dio algo, mientras tú te arriesgabas

Algo pasajero te condenó a perderme

Esta se la hice a ella, ella
Que se cree que por ser bella, ella
Puede robarme todo lo que nunca tuvo ella
Se la hice a ella, ella
Porque aunque sea tan bella, ella
Cada que te acaricie tu piel ya tendrá mis huellas
Hoy quiero decirle a ella
Que si fue así conmigo también lo será con ella

[Verso 2]
Tú no te mereces nada, no estoy hablando contigo
Ella se merece menos de lo que hiciste conmigo
Aunque intente sorprenderte, siempre será su castigo
Que todo lo que te haga tú ya lo hiciste conmigo

Hoy quiero decirle a ella
Que si fue así conmigo también lo será con ella

[Verse 3]
Ella jugó a darte lo que más querías
Yo jugué a creerte que nunca lo harías
Ella con un beso, yo con mil razones
Para estar confiando en tus explicaciones

[Estribillo]
Esta se la hice a ella, ella
Que se cree que por ser bella, ella
Puede robarme todo lo que nunca tuvo ella
Se la hice a ella, ella
Porque aunque sea tan bella, ella
Cada que te acaricie tu piel ya tendrá mis huellas
Hoy quiero decirle a ella
Que si fue así conmigo también lo será con ella"

When the sun comes shining through
Lighting up what’s left of you
And you put it all aside for another day
Pick it up and rearrange it
Though you know that you won’t change it
Cause you’ve always been a stranger anyway
Now you left your window open
Just to keep your spirit rolling
But you’re hoping that your mind will close the door
Take it up two steps higher
When you’re drowning in the fire
The hope you had helped you on along the way

[Chorus]
If the story feels exactly like a dream
Don’t know what it means
Things ain’t what they seem
And you can’t just turn the page and let it go
Things that you’ve been told
Are deep down in your soul

[Verse 2]
Now don’t make your move too early
Or you’ll show up in a hurry
You can fall down and surely lose your way
Heaven help you if you mean it
Cause there's those that would defeat it
They can turn you around and take it all away
Now don't look down in the dirt
Just to find out what you’re worth
Cause that song and dance was never worth the time
So work hard and do it right
Learn to speak up and to fight
The truth is gonna beat them down the line

[Chorus]
If the story feels exactly like a dream
Don’t know what it means
Things ain’t what they seem
And you can’t just turn the page and let it go
Things that you’ve been told
Are deep down in your soul

If the story feels exactly like a dream
Don’t know what it means
Things ain’t what they seem
And you can’t just turn the page and let it go
Things that you’ve been told
Are deep down in your soul

If the story feels exactly like a dream
Don’t know what it means
Things ain’t what they seem
And you can’t just turn the page and let it go
Things that you’ve been told
Are deep down in your soul

If the story feels exactly like a dream
Don’t know what it means
Things ain’t what they seem
And you can’t just turn the page and let it go
Things that you’ve been told
Are deep down in your soul

If the story feels exactly like a dream
Don’t know what it means
Things ain’t what they seem
And you can’t just turn the page and let it go
Things that you’ve been told
Are deep down in your soul

If the story feels exactly like a dream
Don’t know what it means
Things ain’t what they seem
And you can’t just turn the page and let it go
Things that you’ve been told

If the story feels exactly like a dream
Don’t know what it means

I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoyin'
I just wanna make you feel like everythin' I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything, you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walkin' towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you

That's parents for you

How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothin's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?

What else can I offer you?
There's nothin' left right now, I gave it all to you

Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work and prolly woulda figured things out
But, I guess I'm a letdown
But, it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughin'?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but, at least you're happy

Yo mom, who thought that this could happen

[Dionne]
Nobody but me

[Ray J]
Love is what we need
So if you get that, the blessing will proceed, so please give back

[Big Daddy Kane]
Coming at ya, mob deep on this song
And now it's on
Come together for born
Better yet form Voltron
Spread love like mustard, bust it, making knowledge be born
So trust it, it's B-D-K, learn to love it

[Dionne Warwick](Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love

[Flesh Bone]
I know just exactly what world needs now, plead it
Everybody come show a little love for your family, Jesus we need it   And
Even when I flip through the pages of my history
Slowly reveal the mystery
Got to get it together quickly, in this industry

[Dionne Warwick]
Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last till the end of time

[Kurupt]
Yo, yo, yo
I could see far and beyond, me and my auntie Dionne
With the homie Fazon, who's cool as freon
As the music plays on, portrays and stays on
Got this thing together, got to get our game together
Life is life and if your ears are open
You could see when you scope doors closed or open
Whether you're in or you're out
You're always in and that's for sure
And that's what friends are for, for what the world needs

[Dionne Warwick] (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now

[Dionne Warwick]
Lord, we don't need another meadow
There are cornfields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and monnbeams enough to shine
Listen Lord, if you want to know

[Mic G]
Give me this drug, they call it love
I'd pump it off around the world
To touch the soul of every man, woman, child, boy and girl

[Royal Flush]
I pray that we could live together on this family tree
Royal Flush and Mic G, we want the world to see

[Big Daddy Kane]
What's happening
Is the matter when the people traveling
To grasp a pen and pad and then this united gathering
Keep it on the love, love if you expect the vibe
Work it out just like an exercise, shame of

[Dionne Warwick] (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
What the world needs no
Come on can we have unity
Just a little bit of unity, brother
Just a little bit, just a little bit of love baby

[Coolio]
L is for the lies that they told and the lines that they crossed
When they burglarized my soul, they cold
O is for the outsiders looking in, times is looking grim
You can't even trust your friends, damn
V, cause it's very necessary
That various policies get variated and eradicated, I hate it
E is for the extra mile you had to walk
Just to talk to your homie who was locing
And to show him you have love for him

[Dionne Warwick]
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now
It's the only thing that there's just too little of

[Flesh Bone]
We humbly gather together united with almighty power
Ready to rumble at any hour
Got love and it won't let me stumble, follow me

[Dionne Warwick]
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now

[Tyrese] (Fades out)
Can we get together, I'm on my way, baby
Come on get together, unity
We can unify the hip-hop nation"

Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Verse 2]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found

Take me home
Take me home

[Verse 1: Lisa Lisa]
Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
'Cause I'm not too sure 'bout how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end up hurt

[Pre-Chorus: Lisa Lisa, Mike Hughes]
Oh, I don't know
That's the way that I feel (
I just don't know

I'm so afraid of a one night deal (

Lately, you've been expressing to me
Just how much you want to make love
I want it just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch?
You say I'm teasing, but I do have a reason
Don't let your feelings fade
'Cause you will have me, and sooner than you know it
If you could only wait

[Spoken Interlude: Mike Hughes, Lisa Lisa]
They say beauty lies in the eye of the beholder (Oh-oh)
You're not sure you're the beholder of my eyes?
I gave our relationship more credit than it deserves
No, it's just that I feel you're rushing me
Okay, okay, since you don't love me
You don't wanna be with me
No, it's not that
It's just that I'm afraid of getting hurt
I don't know, I just keep asking myself
Should I really take you home?
What do you think?

[Outro: Mike Hughes, Lisa Lisa]
Take me, take me, take me home
Take me, take me, take me home
Take me, take me, take me home

I was in the dark in need of love
But then i turned away from them who fucked me over
I live just like a thug
Crashing different windows in my hood
Just to show the world that im a fucking marvel

Cause I'm addicted to pain it's my heroin
Feel the strangest things creeping under my skin
And i know that it's real cause I'm dancing
Yeah im dancing
On my heroin

Feel the strangest things creeping under my skin
And i know that it's real cause I'm dancing
Yeah im dancing
On my heroin

Breathe breathe breathe it out
Feeling all the chemicals hitting my blood
And i know that it wont stop because im hurting
Fill fill fill my cup
Pour some alcohol in please mister
Give me something good, so i will stop the dancing

So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Verse 2]
And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

[Pre-Chorus]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Bridge]
Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

[Verse 3]
I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could make you mine

My heart has been a chessboard
Making moves and losing out
Played so many times before
And there ain't nothing to brag about
But this must be a new brew
When you're gone I'm singing Blue Moon
You turn me all the way around
And I'm tired of the fine line

[Chorus]
I just want you to be forever mine
Be forever mine

Oh and there's nothing I can sing now
That ain't been sung before
Oh but your love is a standout
So go on ahead and take the floor
You had to Jimi my heart loose
Now I'm stuck in your voodoo
Pick me up, don't ever put me down
Look I'm tired of the fine line

I just want you to be forever mine
I want you to be forever mine

The way that you move, never seen it before
Looking for my head, can’t find it no more
You ransom my heart and I get the reward
Winning the crown like a Trojan horse
I come back, back, back every time
You got me shook like the Mobb when they rhyme
Come out of nowhere come blessing my life
I just want you to be forever mine, oh oh

[Chorus]
Be forever mine
Be forever mine

[Verse 3]
Oh but you was cookin' up a new stew
Must have put something in my food
Cause now I'm lost up in the clouds

Journey with me into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killa since I came out the nutsack
I'm in a murderous mind state
With a heart full of terror, I see the devil in the mirror
Buck-buck, lights out
'Cause when I grab my sawed off, niggas get hauled off (Haha)
Barrel one tears your motherfuckin' flesh (Yeah)
Barrel two tears your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see, I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9, so if you try to wreck mine, fool, it's your bedtime
Feel the blast from the chocolate bomber
Infrared aimed at your head like your name was Sarah Connor
Decapitation, I ain't hesitatin' to put you in a
Funeral home with a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava, you got a problem?
I got a problem solver and his name is Revolver

Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my mama 'cause I scare her
I want to blast motherfuckers (Yeah, what's up?)
It feels like I'm bustin' a nut when I open you up
'Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
'Cause I'm givin' dirt naps
Comin' with them bomb-ass raps to make your lungs collapse, perhaps
You never sleep 'cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose
Ain't seen the sun in sixty-six days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never, ever, ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how you're livin'
I'm the unforgivin', psycho-driven murderer
It's authentic, don't panic
I can't stand it, goddamn it, schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck, hit him with a brick and I'm dancin'

And I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna—

I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sounds of sirens
Terrified screams from the streams of strychnine
Dumpin' on any motherfucker tryin' to trick mine
'Cause punk motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold, and they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain, migraine
Headache, I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Got his ass whipped with twenty lashes like they do up in Singapore
So I'ma pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer
Now he's suicidal, just like Nirvana

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre & Ice Cube]
Tick-tock, tock-tick, tock-tick
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keepin' niggas in order, makin' their lives shorter
Ready to slaughter, 'cause to me, a life ain't worth a quarter
Or a dime, mushrooms got my mind
Hallucinatin', ain't no debatin', I'm creatin'
An escape route to be out without a doubt
Scot-free, so don't even think about tryna stop me
'Cause I can't wait, I'm out the gate
On the for realer, a thrilla from a natural born killa
Gitchi gitchi ya ya, they call me Dada

I don't know if I should break down or try to pray
So I dance with the devil I guess my life's cliche (My life's cliche)

[Verse 2: Reefuh]
Yeah, tango 'round with the devil I hope I make it out
Got my wings in the sky I been waiting to sprout
I can't fight all your battles no I been going around
Attempts at your loyalty but you going around
Funky Friday boy let's get down
I got poison of ivy know it's taking 'em down

[Bridge: Staggy]
Tie her down not a Burberry coat
Now when she type my name always murder she wrote

[Chorus: Staggy & Reefuh]
That's when I met with the devil, he said that I'll be okay
Now I got rocks on my bezel, so I don't care what you say
And ain't no one on my level so get the fuck out my way
'Cause baby now I'm a rebel I gotta start it today
Got [?] from pebbles no I was feelin' astray
No you are not on my level the words you [?] say
I don't know if I should break down or try to pray
So I dance with the devil I guess my life's cliche (My life's cliche)"

In the day, we sweat it out on the streets
Of a runaway American dream
At night, we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were

[Verse 2]
Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones
Scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss
Huh

[Instrumental Break]
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 3]
The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
But 'til then, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

[Outro]
Oh honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Come on Wendy, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Jab woh karte hain rap leke nakli si cap
Main leta hoon ubaasi…
Uh, jaise main karoon Hindi mein rap
Koyi karke dikhao aise
Uh, mere jaisa main bas main ek
Roz ke dekhun 36 tum jaise

Tere gaano mein kasar
Aage niklega kaise
Uh, 30 lakh ek show ka bina kisi album

Jeeta hoon aaj ke liye main
Lekin meri nazrein hain kal pe
Main hoon banda kameena
Bhool ke bhi na jaana iss bholi si shakal pe
Tum jaison ke to hath bhi nahi aaunga
Auto mein aaya automatic mein jaunga
Jo bhi kaha tha sab karke dikhaunga
Bollywood ko Chandigarh mein bithaaunga
Main likhta rahunga
Jo bhi jee mein aaye meer likhta rahunga

Karun to bhi bikta rahunga

[Verse 1]
What's wrong or what's right?
I'm 'bouta take a flight, like, should I say goodbye?
Fuck that, I'ma hold onto my pride
Momma raised a soldier, so I can't afford to cry
Looking back, I see the knife in my back now
Looking at life, wishing I was in the background
Looking back, I see the future in the past now
Ninety in the whip, like, should I fucking crash now?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why'd you ask what's wrong when you saw me?
I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why'd you ask what's wrong when you saw me?

[Verse 2]
Chemicals running through my veins, I just wanna sleep
Feelings bleeding out my brain, but right now I can't feel a thing
Woke up late, time to waste away
My favorite days are the rainy days
Let it soak in then I throw it all away
I try my best, but this feeling always stays
You know I try, but you gotta give me space
And I don't wanna hurt you if you get in my way

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why'd you ask what's wrong when you saw me?
I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why'd you ask what's wrong when you saw me?

[Verse 3]
Reach out just to waste my time
It's the young waste of space with his headphones on
Call me when you need me, baby, but I know I'm the last resort
You said that you loved me, how the fuck could you just love a ghost?
You said that you love me, baby, I said we are not that close

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening

At a different way to the play the same game
And as my view takes on, on this new shape
The situation seems to change

I’ve got to backup, and look for a brighter day
I’ve got to see the road ahead, to pave a new way

And on those longer city days, as I  watch those children play
I hear my grandma’s voice, and the way she used to say:

Take the longview, is what matters most
Can’t see to clearly, from up so close

Got to backup, let my mind see

From the shoreline, to the horizon
From Atlanta to Zimbabwe
If our focus, comes together
We will live on in better ways
We’ve just go to
Listen without ears, see without eyes
Take action based on how we feel inside

I’ve got to backup, and look for a brighter day
I’ve got to see the road ahead, to pave a new way

[Chorus] x1

Got to back up, and let my mind see
Got to focus on, what’s good for me

And if I only see the shorter view, I’ll be a fool
Got to back up, and do right
Take the longview and hold it in my sight

I’ve got to take the longview
I’ve got to take the longview
I’ve got to take the longview"

Te invito a pasar por mi corazón
Entra despacito y ponte en acción
Tú entiendes eso de la seducción
Y por lo que veo a la perfección
Mira qué bonita esta situación:
Los dos en mi cama, luego el sillón
Apaga la luz, no quiero visión
Quiero que tú sientas mi sensación
Tú que estás conmigo y yo pobretón
Mereces tu parte de mi millón
Mereces una pieza en mi mansión
Merezco una pizca de tu calor
A mi día gris le pones color
Y a mi día bueno lo haces mejor
No gastes dinero en tu blusa Dior
A mí me gusta más tu ropa interior

[Pre-Estribillo]
Y vámono', a fuego
Me quemas, te quemo
Tú te vas, yo muero
Tú estás, yo vuelvo

Nena te llevo pa' donde tú quieras si quieres hasta el amanecer
Sólo Dios será testigo de todas las cosas que vamos a hacer
Tengo mi objetivo claro, mantenerte aquí, no te quiero perder
Rompamos esa rutina y fluyamos sólo como tiene que ser

Fuck

[Verse 1]
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Verse 2]
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

Take notes on how I crept, I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least, no, no, it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find somethin' to do better, bet
I sets up trap, so shut up that
Nonsense about some silent— silent—
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right

I chill with Wesson, got my reasons, so tell me, what did you expect?

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know

If he's holdin' onto you so tight

I just hope you're lyin' next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then, I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

You better get ready for a big surprise
You think it's almost over but it's only the rise
Mental message via visual contact
Louder than any other sexual soundtrack

[Verse 1: Chito Miranda]
More margarita for my cute senorita
Triple the tequila just to heighten up the flava
Chuggin' down on my JMB
While checkin' out the parts of my date's anatomy
Forget the brains, forget the personality
What I'm after is your effect on my gravity
Like Trinity flying high with her kicks
And controlling the game with my heavy duty joystick

You better get ready for a big surprise
You think it's almost over but it's only the rise
Mental message via visual contact
Louder than any other sexual soundtrack

[Verse 2: Chito Miranda]
Flip the tip as we skip to the next trip
Flashing some cash and some rock star bullshit
Going in for the thrill moving in for the kill
I got us a room in a fancy hotel
And we got everything we need
A big bag of money a bigger bag of weed
And we try to impress as we start to undress
Stop the press, we need to get this

You better get ready for a big surprise
You think it's almost over but it's only the rise
Mental message via visual contact
Louder than any other sexual soundtrack

I'd like to keep it going 'cause I got it going on
But it's Vinci's turn on the microphone, so
Ehem, my name is Vinci and I am neat, I love pretty girls and I love to eat
I made this rap from my mind and I am very very kind
I like to drive fast in fancy cars and chicks dig me like chocolate bars
You say I'm bad but I am good so shut up now and eat some food
Tsong, ano bang problema mo? Ayusin mo naman
Lagyan mo naman ng tono para kang nangangatwiran
Ano bang inaatupag mo sa bago mong apartment?
Sampung taon ka nang sikat, wala ka pa rin bang talent?
Tsong. ano bang sinasabi mo? Mali ang sinasabi mo
Magaling akong kumanta, alam mo ba 'yung ""Picha Pie""?
Kung sa bagay, mahusay nga naman 'yung ""Picha Pie""
Gamit ang boses mong pamatay, nilagyan mo ng kulay ang kanta
'Di ba kahit ikaw ang gumawa?
Alam nating mas okay nung ako 'yung kumanta
Tsong naman, please lang, 'wag ka nang magyabang
At alam mo naman na pang-back-up ka lang
At ilan na ba ang talagang nagawa mong kanta? Ilan?
Wala eh, ano ngayon?

[Refrain: Parokya Ni Edgar]
Alam naman nating lahat na si Vinci naman talaga dapat
Ang vocalist ng parokya band ng Parokya Ni Edgar

[Verse 4: Chito Miranda, Vinci, Dindin]
Teka lang one minute, pwede bang pakiulit?
Maaaring may lamang ka sa paligo
Subalit bakit mo naman nasabi na ikaw ang nararapat?
Eh ni isang kanta man lang wala kang naisulat
Eh ba't ibang singers naman kahit 'di niya sinulat
Ang kinakanta nilang kanta ay sobra kung sumikat
Tulad ko at ni Quino at ni Benedict Aquino
Na wala nga yatang mas sisikat pa kahit na sino
Ewan ko sandali, 'wag ka ngang makulit
Kung ayaw mong masipa sa mukha ng malupet
Baka makatikim ka ng sasuwela de kamao
Na si listo el de gato sa gulpihang de kontodo
Talaga, hindi nga, tatawa na ba ako?
Hindi porket Koreano ka magaling kang mag-taekwando
'Wag kang mag-aangas sa lalaking may balbas
Kami 'yung mga tipo na hindi umaatras
Sandali lang, 'wag muna kayong maglaban
Bago kayo magsuntukan
Ba't 'di niyo muna pag-usapan ang 'di maunawaan?
Sige na, kiss na, peace na please
Ang bayad mo sa jeepney, kulang pa ng diyesKung ayaw mong mangyari ang nangyari sa iba
Matuto tayo kung paano magpakumbaba
'Wag nating kalimutan kung saan nagsimula

[Refrain: Parokya Ni Edgar]
Alam naman nating lahat na mahal namin ang isa't isa't
Walang iwanan sa parokya band sa Parokya Ni Edgar
Band, band

Ah, 'di ko alam kung paano tatapusin 'yung kanta
Kaya ganito na lang bigla nalang mawawala"

They tryna build homes with the niggas I be ducking
I ain't sweating no nigga, I can get 'em by the dozen
Hoes steady be like, ""Friend,"" but be on the 'Gram subbing
I ain't with all of that talking, I can get a bitch slapped down
Hoes screaming they don't like me, see 'em running in a pack now
Ayy, hoes hit the follow, now they think they know my background
Instead of asking who I'm fucking, ask your nigga wherе he at now
And I hear a lot of capping from the back row, flеxing from the flat broke
Whole lot of noise from hoes ain't seen a hundred bands close
Hoes couldn't see me even magnify glass close
And no I ain't Doja, but they still do what I say so (Look, ayy)
I got niggas texting back to back, ain't even put no pussy on 'em
Bitches on a fake page mad I took they nigga from 'em
I ain't hard to find, why they acting like they looking for me?
If they wanna trip, I hope the bitch can pay to book it for me
So unbothered, got hoes bothered
Tell 'em go'n and hang that shit up, next caller
Ayy, the most hate from hoes looking for they next dollar
Doing big shit, hoes' moves much smaller
Ayy, ayy, I just fuck with him for money, you fuck with him tryna marry
Me and them is not the same, wish they stop all that comparing
You be sad behind a ho (I wish the fuck I would)
All on Twitter in your feelings, looking bad behind a ho
No, not me, that ain't P
I don't nothing else, I'ma keep shit G
Block hoes, they no call ID
That's how you know the pussy is G-U-D
Bitches swear they did it first, it's looking like a repeat
Fuck I look like arguing with a ho that wanna be me?
They been looking lost without me, these bitches need me
The way they in my business, you would think they my employees
Find you something to do
It's been like seven years since I seen a check stub
They ain't even do me dirty and still got me messed up
A bitch never checked me or came at me messed up
Shit ain't working out, I guess they tryna get they reps up
All in the mirror like, ""Damn, I wanna fuck her""
I'd shoot the club up and wouldn't use a rubber
Bitch, you either like me or don't, if you 'bout it, make it known
And since they quiet, this can't be what bitches want, for real

Hoes might not like it, but I bet they niggas love it, love it

Wanna take it shopping, wanna leave it roses

We had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on, darlin', come here, darlin')
We did everything together
Yeah, we would wake up early in the mornin' (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need is just one wish)

Used to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)

Damn, baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you—

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact, I was the one who said I loved you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
'Cause we couldn't be alone
See, your mama knew I was somethin' else, she knew how I felt
Back then, we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up, I was a fool and I can't lie, I'm missin' you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it

[Pre-Chorus]
Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

[Chorus]
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Makin' love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

[Post-Chorus]
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now, tell me, is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so, then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be lovin' me, holdin' me, kissin' me
So girl, don't tell me what I'm feelin' is make-believe
I swear, if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you, I'm sick

[Pre-Chorus]
Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

[Chorus]
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin (Startin' here, right now)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you (Promise love), trust me, I'll trust you (I'll trust you)
If I had one wish, we would run away (Yes, we would)
Makin' love all day (It would feel so good), have us a baby (Woo)
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life (Oh, yeah)
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

[Bridge]
I don't even know how we ended up on this road
And, even though we are grown, girl, I just want you to know

[Chorus]
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin (Introducin' yourself all over again)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo (Would you be my girlfriend?)
Promise to love you (Yes, I promise to love you), trust me, I'll trust you (Trust me, baby, and I'll trust you)
If I had one wish (One wish), we would run away (One wish)
Makin' love all day (One wish), have us a baby (Have us a baby)
If I had one wish (Ooh), I'd make you my whole life (Yes, I will)
And you'll be my wife (Yes, I will), make it right this time
If I had one wish, we would be best friends (Some people wish to be a superstar, wish to have a fancy car)
Love would never end, it would just begin (Wish to have a million bucks, I'm wishin' on bein' in love)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo (So feel me, pretty baby)
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you (I'd make one wish and I'd wish it all on you)
If I had one wish (Oh), we would run away (Oh)
Makin' love all day, have us a baby (Makin' love 'til the break of dawn, me and you 'til the baby's born)
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life (Yeah, yeah)
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish"

[Strofa 1]
Non mi toccare perché ti odio
Non cancellarmi perché ho bisogno
Di rimanerti in testa
Il tempo di sfatare il sogno
E riderò finché non passa
E ti capisco perché è la stessa
Malinconia di quando
Tutto torna e niente resta
Cosa ti lascio di me?
E di te cosa prendo?
Prendo un tatuaggio, prendo quella sera
Prendo questa lacrima
E cosa mi lasci di te?
E di me tu cosa prendi?
Scegli una canzone, scegli il mio silenzio
Scelgo di non rivederti

[Ritornello]
Nasce dal colore di una rosa appassita un'altra vita
Poche idee o sempre le stesse, prometto: ""Basta promesse""
E ho cambiato e ho cambiato e anche fosse l’ultima fermata
Lascio la mia vita molto meglio di come l'ho trovata

Fermo agli ostacoli, accetto miracoli

[Strofa 2]
Andiamo altrove, ma torneremo
Non ti ho mai avuto, ma tu nemmeno
Non temi neanche Dio
E spero ti perdoni lui almeno
Lo avevo già previsto
Le conseguenze sono tue
Ti avevo avvisato, per l'ultima volta
E con questa sono due

[Ritornello]
Nasce dal colore di una rosa appassita un’altra vita

È difficile capire se esisto
E nonostante tutto ora mi guardo
E poi mi chiedo dove vai

Yo, man, I don't think they heard you?
Won't you tell 'em what your name is?

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
My name is Eazy, yeah, this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore, yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with a touch of my rhyme
Suckers stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is Eazy or just call me E
But it doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I cold get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actual fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo, I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who tries to cope
If the rhyme I'm displayin'
And the beat that's playin'
Yo, you could try all-day
And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W
'Cause Eazy's doin' it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some
Yo, it's easier said than done

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Woo, woo!

[Verse 2: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
Now it's easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss, yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trauma
With the E-A-Z-Y-E comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third dimension
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like you're there
With the E on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
'Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor, not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on Ruthless and that's my label
To get the money, the women, and cold bust the fat cables, boy
Master Rhyme's a toy
I mean straight, while you suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick, or you lonely
How you gonna diss me if you don't even know me?
Yo Ren! (
Whassup?
)
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin' your cap
To let you know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall be done

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Woo, woo!

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
Creating dope jams is a part of the cycle
""Eazy-er Said Than Dunn"", yeah, that's the title
Lovin' the ladies, only the fly ones, ya know?
(
But what if she's ugly?
)
Eazy come Eazy go
Don't ask to battle me, homeboy, what's that?
You wanna battle me? Boy, ya better be strapped
'Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
Now, that's what I'm sayin'
Said before that I was born in '73
Now everybody wants to know the A-G-E
Girls on the tip, fellas too, it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15
The fellas would ignore me
The ladies would adore me
And what was I to do?
I wish they’d let the ladies through
'Cause the ladies, I love 'em
Nice, tender and soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real Eazy, those others be fakin'
Tryin' to gain fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some
Yo, homeboy, it's easier said than done

Fuck Jay-Z
You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Fuck Jay-Z

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like a AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best, Pac, Nas and B.I.G.?
Ain't no best, east, west, north, south, flossed out
Greetings, I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage (Uh)
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne
I got this locked since '91 (Uh), I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music, check it

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly (Haha)
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)

[Interlude]
Ayo, pass me the weed (Tsk, there you go)
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man (Ain't no doubt)
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the motherfuckin' ring

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle
This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made a album called 
Blueprint
 (Dick)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G., dick-suckin' lips (Ha)
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live?

[Interlude]
I will
Not lose (God's son across the belly, I'll prove you lost already), uh
The king is back
Where my crown at? (Ill Will)
Ill Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)
Negro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick
So little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss"

Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene

So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice (Don't think twice)
Do think twice (A-hoo)

Intentionally I believe my demise
Was my own stupid invention
With wide open eyes, I said goodbye to the guys
And set sail for my destruction
I was functioning then, as I'm functioning now
Way below my potential

Scared out of my mind
Going inside without too much hesitation
Rendered defenseless at the slightest hint of suggestion
I'm petrified, and I'm fucked if I do, and I'm fucked if I don't
Accept defeat and kiss the feet of oblivion
I've waited for too long for something wrong
Somewhat expectantly

And I told myself lies if I'm lying around
And it don't trickle down in the same direction
I was reckless to dissolve at your resolve
To make an object of attraction
But dissatisfaction pushed me over a cliff edge
And there will be no cold retraction
But I crossed the room with every knowledge of your cold
But I hope that I could make a spun without it catching up on

I'll go
With your master plan
I'll be putty in your hands
You're the mastermind

Inevitably
I will float down river
It's a foregone conclusion
I will be delivered
Straight into your hands
For you to have your way
Easy come and go
Easily led astray

It's too easy
Say it, say it
It's just like taking candy from a baby

I'm easy
Go on say it
Put my hand
Right into the mouth of danger

Baby, I'm ready to give in to the night
It's in the liquid that we take to elevate
Are you coming to find me, or waiting up till I'm dead?
The kindness kills an act of will, but we'll always fall in line
Don't hesitate, they make you perjure what you say
There is no mastermind
There's no mastermind"

How do you think he does it? 
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 2: Roger Daltrey & Pete Townshend]
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]
Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball"

Me faire plus d'argent, me faire plus de haineux
J'me tiens bien droit, mes diamants brillent
Je l'ai baisée une fois, elle croit qu'on sort ensemble
J'peux l'dépenser, j'l'ai économisé
Je vais te faire tourner, si t'essaies de te jouer avec moi
J'ai chopé les millions, et j'les faisais avec un RAZR
À l'époque où je vendais deux bigos pour cinq balles, appelle-moi sur mon RAZR
Les négros n'ont jamais dû me le donner, je le veux, je le prends
Garanti de dire au revoir à une salope si elle veut pas de se mettre à poil

Hmm, je dois sortir de ma chambre
J'ai d'autres mauvaises ondes qui arrivent en moi

This is a ghetto public announcement
Roll your blunts tight and light your joints
Inhale, slowly exhale, and that's how you get high
I know you don't smoke weed... I know this
But I'm gonna get you high today
'Cause it's Friday, you ain't got no job, and you ain't got shit to do

[Hook]
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy

Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy

[Verse 1]
Eyes hella red, got my dank from the Bahamas
Went to see my girl smoked some green with her mama
Jumped in my Cutlass on the way to the liquor store
Picked up some blunts, got ten on the 2-0
Fix these palm trees wit some green leaves
Now a nigga head spinning like the seven seas
Puff, puff, pass, nigga that's what Simon say
Fools, hog the weed or da green - gon' get carried away
Fingernails burnt, lookin' like a tweeker
Ears steady poppin', but not from the speakers
Green got me hungry, fiendin' for them munchies
'Cause real smokers don't blow no fuckin' green on empty stomachs

[Hook]
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy

[Verse 2]
Green trees, backwoods, make cabbage
I like to get high but it ain't a bad habit
Cigar with that weed smoke comin out my 'lac
Got a hottie in the front and one in the back
Blowin' shotguns to me and my homie
I feel like this weed make a young nigga horny
I stopped the fuckin' 'lac at Holiday Inn
I ain't even trippin', told the girls to come in
Laid her down steady 'cause she know I'm ready
Choppin' up weed like motherfuckin' spaghetti
Hoes down south must know voodoo
'Cause every time I hit the weed I'm lookin' for Isuzus

[Hook]
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy

My life trapped in between
A whisper and a scream
A suicide machine of my own making
You medicate my brain
Like needles in my veins
Consumed in your embrace
There's no escaping

My fix is the misery
Won't stop till the end of me
I can't feel anything

[Chorus]
Killing me one breath at a time
Caught in your web, I'm paralyzed
So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless, painless

(I can't, I can't, I can't)
I can't feel any pain
(I can't, I can't, I can't)

I drift into the gray
Half coma, half awake
My soul is yours to take
A waist-full river

I feel you under my skin
The knife is twisting within
Temptation always wins
It's never over

My fix is the misery
Won't stop till the end of me

My life, my grave
Do you love me enough to finish me off
Don't leave me here this way

So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless

Feel the change in me tonight
Κατι αλλαξε μεσα μου αποψε
So take me up, take me higher
Ετσι ανεβασε με ανεβασε με ψηλοτερα
There's a world not far from here
Υπαρχει ενας κοσμος πολυ κοντα μας

Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

She works for the weekend, mix-tape of her favorite bands
Tearing up the radio, lost in the stereo's sound
She's trouble in a tank-top, pretty little time-bomb
Blowing up - take you down
Living in the radio, lost in the stereo's sound

[Chorus]
She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's outta control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

[Verse 2]
Shake-down on a Saturday
Sit back, gotta catch my breath
'Cause every time I see her
Know she's gonna take it back somehow
Tattoos and a switch-blade attitude
Snakebite heart with a bubble-gum smile
Sex in stereo, don't turn the radio dial

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful

I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

And I'm just like cellophane
'Cause she sees right through me
I know she's glitter and gold
And that's just the price I pay
When I don't even know her name
She's slipping away

Know what I'm sayin'? I'm on another level though
I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National
I got my own record label, you heard of us
The Posse Family Cartel, you know what I'm sayin', we real
Who this nigga thing he is?

[Verse 2]
I'mma house hold name, wit' game spittin' outta my mouth at all times
I spit it out and about, and spit outta the south,until they recognize the danger signs
So feel a tingle in yo' s-spine, by the way I talk
And it's pimpin' in my blood, you can tell by the way I walk
Ooh lawd, more styles than a barber shop, call the cops
People in the way wanna baller block
Little do they know that I'm callin' shots
And I'm not to be fucked with
If you see me comin' 'round the corner, then duck quick, perpetrators can suck dick
I tried to tell 'em, but they dont wanna listen
I tried to shine 'em, but they dont wanna glisten, while the high hat keeps on tickin'
And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools
Cuz rules were made to be broken, but you can't make broken rules
Hear what I'm sayin' or heard what I said
Hear what they playin', cuz thru this music I'mma still be heard if I'm dead
Call ya' producers, cuz I'm hurtin' these beats
I said it once, I'll say it twice, biatch, Disturbin' Tha Peace
C'mon

Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
""Never Leave Me Alone"", ""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish rope with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, ""Baby please, you out here serving stress""
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

[Chorus]
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

[Verse 2]
I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his Stars untied
And a blue and grey cap that said ""The Eastside""
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said, ""He would grow up to be nothing but a gangster""
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

[Chorus]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 3]
I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
(scratching) And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said ""Sorry, Warren G, but there's no help wanted""
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like ""Warren, welcome to my store""
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors

[Chorus]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 4]
Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, ""Can I be down champ?""
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
""Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to see Daz back in the day""
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

[Chorus]
You caught the vapors
You caught the vapors"

But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong

Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this
Long and winding road

Keeps me together

If you only knew
(If you only knew)
How i wanna be down with you
How i want to be down


[Verse 1: Fat Pat]
You could be my baby baby if you keep it real
One love for a thug let me tell you how i feel
So real when i hold your body close to mine
Every time i'm with ya' man i swear its going down
Smelling sweet like roses and i suppose that you are the one that i have chosen not proposing
But i wanna' get in ya' take you away like Calgon your mind in a splendor
Do you remember the first time we made love heart pumping so fast as we push and we shove
I can see it in your eyes you have feelings for me baby but the situation crazy because i got a lady
Don't get me wrong because i love to get with ya
Hit me on the down low on the page come getcha' Ill be there in a sec
Go get a room and let's wreck
Lay back and hit it again
One more time and lets jet
Don't let nobody knock this thing that we got
Like them brawds in the beauty shop talking a lot they want what ya' got
It ain't no doubt about that passing they number winkin' they eyes at this player Fat Pat
I told you that you can't speak your hand cause that capping and that bragging make them want yo man
Do what i can and when i got the time if you love me like ya say baby you will stay down
(Can you feel me)


[Chorus: Celicia Ward]
If you only knew
(If you only knew)
How i wanna be down with you
(How i want to be down)
If you only knew
(If you only knew)
How i wanna be down with you
(How i wanna to be down)


[Verse 2:Fat Pat]
Low key place we meet you never been before adding spice to your life feelings can't ignore
Mind soars through the clouds sometimes its hard to see who i love the most my gal or my late night creep
Confused at times but i gotta go home talking to you on my celly till i turn on my corner
I can't get enough of this player life i wish there was some kind of way i could make you both my wife
Sleep with the both at night without a fuss or fight
Ménage à trois all the way to the middle of the night it feels so right to have you both on my side
I couldn't imagine my life without my brawd and my wife
(Its going down)


[Chorus: Celicia Ward]
If you only knew
How i wanna be down with you
(You'll never know)
If you only knew
(How i want to be down)
How i want to be down with you
(How i want to be down)



[Verse 3: Fat Pat]
I feel the pain you feel when you call me and cry
I'm just a player though ain't no way i can deny
No matter how hard i try to keep it real baby girl its the dog in me that keeps the spark up in your world
Your homegirls tell you to leave me but they just don't understand how serious the love between you and your man
That's why i'm down with you no matter what you do because you always stay true and you call me boo
The whip appears on you now what we gon' do in this long term thing
No more bumping and grinding you scream my name
I ain't the one to blame you couldn't keep your cool before you lose control know what you wanna do
Cause there ain't no turning back when the doors is closed
Meet a new brawd same thing happens once more
I'm just a playa' and that's all it is
Big pimpin' showing skills just keeping it real


[Chorus: Celicia Ward]
If you only knew
(and if you only knew)
How i want to be down with you
(How i wanna be down)
If you only knew
(If you only)
How i want to be down with you
(Be Down)
Only knew
(If i could tell you)
How i want to be down with you
If you only knew

[Verso 1]
Hoje me sinto inspirado, sou um homem de sorte
Voando mais alto, ficando mais forte
Note que todo menino é um rei
Hoje eu sei, eu estourei um malote
No banco do carona, ela é maravilhosa
Ouvindo Madonna, dançando, espaçosa
Azul e rosa, reflexo neon
Toda convicção pode ser perigosa
Com ela a vida tem momentos incríveis
Com ela todos meus sonhos são mais possíveis
Lucros invisíveis são melhores
Separados somos fortes, juntos imbatíveis
A estrada da vida é a mesma da morte
O ronco do motor consegue ser mais forte
Defendo o malote, nós que conquistamos
Com competência e fé ignoramos sorte

[Pré-Refrão]
Montei o meu esquema, hoje eu tô de nave
Eu e minha pequena na velocidade
Olhos cor de pérola, luz da cidade
Um filme de cinema onde ninguém aplaude

[Refrão]
E ela me diz:
Se tudo é uma ilusão
Eu vivi como eu quis
Se tudo é uma ilusão
Eu vivi como eu quis
Se tudo é uma ilusão
Eu vivi como eu quis
Se tudo é uma ilusão, amor

[Verso 2]
Ontem li um livro que me fez pensar
Erros do passado vale repensar
Sábio feito Buda, mas coração não pensa
Respeita a minha loucura que eu respeito a tua essência
Pode deixar, não vou só criticar o sistema
Sem paciência, organizei meu esquema
Quem não é solução também faz parte do problema
Nossa história é a real glória, digna de cinema
Eu tô no Harlem, tô no TTK
Eu não escrevo rima, meu espírito que toma conta
Apertando aquele que me faz pensar contra
Inimigos fáceis de decifrar
Oi, nada me abala
Rei no microfone, FR som bala
Contra a depressão lutei na marra
Destilando versos fiquei grandão, fala

[Pré-Refrão]
Montei o meu esquema, hoje eu tô de nave
Eu e minha pequena na velocidade
Olhos cor de pérola, luz da cidade
Um filme de cinema onde ninguém aplaude

[Refrão]
E ela me diz:
Se tudo é uma ilusão
Eu vivi como eu quis
Se tudo é uma ilusão
Eu vivi como eu quis
Se tudo é uma ilusão
Eu vivi como eu quis
Se tudo é uma ilusão, amor

[Saída]
Como eu quis, eu vivi
Só vai ser eterno depois do fim
Como eu quis, eu vivi
Só vai ser eterno depois do fim
Como eu quis, eu vivi
Só vai ser eterno depois do fim
Como eu quis, eu vivi
Só vai ser eterno depois do fim
Como eu quis, eu vivi
Só vai ser eterno depois do fim

I told you you were king
Just to fall
I hold the fucking world on my head
Just to keep it out your hands
I won't let it fall
Not at all

[Pre-Chorus: Sidnie Tipton]
I act so bulletproof
But you take me down
You take me down
Gave all I got to you
Now I'm standing my ground
Standing my ground

[Bridge 2: Sidnie Tipton]
I'm no house of cards, house of cards
I'm no house of cards, house of cards, no
I'm no house of cards, house of cards
Not caving into you

[Chorus: Sidnie Tipton]
I'm no house of cards, house of cards
Not caving into you, not caving into you
I'm no house of cards, house of cards
Not for you, oh"

I don't trust nobody
I don't even trust my mind
Losin' everybody
They can never take the grind
People always switchin' sides
People always hit my line
Never ask me how I'm doin'
They just wanna waste my time
So I don't hate nobody
Just stay up out my life
And I won't hurt nobody
So just stay up out my sights
People always pull me down
They just told me that I'd drown
When you livin' how I'm livin'
All these leeches come around

[Verse 1]
'Cause we don't trust nobody
We don't even trust our minds
Losin' everybody
From them drugs to suicide
I was always gettin' high
Never took a look outside
I was livin' in the dark
Thinkin' I would never shine
Now I got everybody
If I want it then it's mine
I help everybody
I'm thinkin' back when it was time
I was broken, I was down
I was lost but now I'm found
I was fightin' in the trenches
With no one ever around
So fuck everybody
If you want it come and get it
I won't hurt nobody
I'm a motherfuckin' menace
I was showerin' at the school
I was sleepin' out the Civic
I was skippin' on my meals
I was reachin' all my limits

[Chorus]
I don't trust nobody
I don't even trust my mind
Losin' everybody
They can never take the grind
People always switchin' sides
People always hit my line
Never ask me how I'm doin'
They just wanna waste my time
So I don't hate nobody
Just stay up out my life
And I won't hurt nobody
So just stay up out my sights
People always pull me down
They just told me that I'd drown
When you livin' how I'm livin'
All these leeches come around

[Verse 2]
'Cause they robbed all my money
And I'll never get it back
I don't fault nobody
'Cause I'm comin' fuckin' back
I just listen to my lawyers
But the judge don't listen back
See they got this full disclosure
And they comin' for my neck
They don't know shit about me
So just give me my respect
All the music that I've made
I ain't never got a check
I been doin' all this shit
With like two hands behind my back
I just focus on my shows
'Cause that's the only thing that's left
You don't know shit about me
That's the reason why you don't come around me
You're scared of me cause I'm talkin' loudly
You can blow that smoke
Won't come around me
You can talk that shit but don't know about it
I see that shit don't talk about it
But I will spray no silver at it
'Cause it's five years
I don't own shit and I'm still drivin'
Like fuck"

They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, its that bounce right here
Come on
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now, straight to the top now
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 1: Diddy & Ginuwine]
Girl, you made me believe again
If you happy, then be with him
Go 'head, mami, breathe again, go 'head, mami, breathe again
Don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head, mami, make it hot now
I need me a love that's gon' make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I been through
And how I had a triflin' mental
So ride with me, G Force, fly with me
Times get hard, cry with me, die with me
White beach sands, lie with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
(This is what I need) So tight, now I understand life

[Chorus: Ginuwine & Mario Winans, Ginuwine, & P. Diddy]
What I need (Yeah, take that), oh, baby
Is a pretty woman next to me (A pretty woman, yeah, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (Dream with me, believe in me) (Come on)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)
Someone who truly understands (Oh, yeah) how to treat a man
(How to treat a man, baby) This is what I need

[Verse 2: Loon, Loon & Ginuwine &  Diddy]
Listen to me now, what should I say now? Come on, ma
Been a whole day, now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime, you'd be a crook to me
'Cause mami, I done been around the world
Seen a lot of places
Been around your girl, believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me to prevail
But I learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin'?
Mami, you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'
I need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'
Confession, my love no contestin'
I need affection
Yes, I need affection, let's go Mario, talk to e'm

[Bridge: Mario Winans, Mario & Ginuwine]
Girl, what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leakin' in your mind
Don't look too good for you and me
Always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby

[Chorus: Mario Winans Mario Winans & Ginuwine]
Is a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man (How to treat a man)
This is what I need

[Verse 3: Diddy]
Ayo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as we're here, then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mami, I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma, I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred-foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl, I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you, I believe in
Love you 'til the day I stop breathing
I love you, girl

[Outro: Ginuwine & Mario Winans, Ginuwine, Mario Winans, Tammy Ruggeri]
This is what I need (Yes, I do)
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me, girl
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands how to treat a man
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
This is what I need (Is that all you want?)
Is a pretty woman next to me (Make the sacrifice)
To share the dreams that I believe (And maybe, maybe we)
Someone who truly understands how to treat a man
This is what I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me

I was born my papa's son

Stick my hand in my pocket, everything's all right

Nocami nie sypiam, a za dnia to budzi mnie buzi, nie budzik
Znalazłem siebie w tym biegu po cele, nie mogę więcej się zgubić (what?)
W chuju mam typie czy znasz mnie i kurwa czy w ogóle lubisz
Kurwa, co? Robię to dla moich ludzi!
Ciało w dziarach jak Yakuza, moja Chi-Chi w moich bluzach
Dzisiaj z ziomami buduję imperium, a kiedyś to leżałem w gruzach
Ciągle mam brudne sumienie, a latam na chmurze genialnego żółwia
To cisza przed burzą, bo po ciszy zawsze jest burza
Zjadam senzu, czuję się jak młody bóg
Młody Goku, gramy sztukę, to się zwykle rzucam w tłum
Buty ujebane w bagnie, typie, możesz na nie pluć
Jestem z wioski liścia, kumasz więc, co wdychałem do płuc
Jak Yakuza nic nie rusza mnie, a ciągle idę w przód
Ichiraku mi dowozi szamę, to jest dieta cud
Ciągle płonę jak jebany Charizard, a w sercu lód
Nie chcą mi wykładać siana, ja wykładam na nich chuj (skrrt)

Z moim składem robię ruchy, z moim składem gramy sztuki
Z moim składem buchy, buchy, z Tobą nie...
Na-na biało ubrany, choć brudne sumienie, mam duszę i myśli
Wiozę pomału się, pierdolę wyścig
Ja i tak czuję się, jakbym zamykał na luzaku licznik
Szymi znów kruszy te zielone szyszki
Nie śpię nocami, w dzień chodzę jak zombie
Nie śpię nocami, bo szykuję bomby
Nie wiem, czy jawa, czy sen, uwięziony w fazie REM
Na ciele blizny i dziary, na głowie mam fazy takie, że ojej
Cały na biało ubrany jak anioł, kiedy ona ściąga mi shirt
Pyta o imię mojego demona, na szyi ma dziarę 666

[Verse 1]
It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

[Pre-Chorus]
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

[Chorus]
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages, till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

[Chorus]
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Come on, come on, baby)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Hello
Who is this
Baby do you realize what time it is
What's up/Nothing's up
I'm asleep
Wait a minute
I thought you weren't talking to me no more
Remember just the other day you were fronting on me
Talking about my head was big now that I'm making records
You now what I'm saying
Oh/ when did you make that change
Well listen/ I got things to do
You know what I'm saying
You got to get off my line
You know/Straight up

[Verse 1]
You say you don't like
The way that I am
Frankly baby
I don't give a damn
After all the things you put me through
I'm not gonna take this
Take this stuff from you

[Chorus]
You say that you can't believe
That a man could be so rude
Hey baby, that's my attitude
You call me up on my phone
Telling me, don't be cruel
Hey baby that's my attitude

[Post-Chorus]
You don't understand why I'm acting like this
You want me to sit here and explain why?
Listen I'm tired of talking, Yo Allen kick it

[Verse 2]
I gave you my money
I gave all my time
All you did was mess around with my mind
Then you go and find you another lover
I want you to know, payback is a mother
(Cry, cry, day and night)
Now you wanna come back
But it just isn't like that
Don't think for a minute
Baby, I'm not with it

Sip nigga, dip nigga, set trip nigga
Got a grip, nigga? Get a grip, nigga, with Tha Gang and
Rollin' with the alpine bangin'
Homie, what you got? A couple sacks to sell
Went from weed to dope to max the sale
Hit the switch, nigga
Don't fuck around with bitch niggas
I'm a money cash nigga, cash gettin', hash hittin'
Gangbang affiliate, hit a stick real quick
And in a minute start killin' shit real quick
I'm a million dollar motherfuckin' nigga
I thought you knew 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it, do you got it?
Now the homies 'bout it, I'm about to do this

Been regarded as the hardest since I hit the set
Young nigga with a rep, kept that gangsta step
Blue croaka sacks or blue Corduroy house shoes on
Flossin' for the hoodrats, gettin' my groove on
Hangin' in the park 'til all hours of dark
Tryin' to catch a mark slippin' with this thing that bark
Cry Baby on the swamp got the exit locked
And ain't no doubt comin' out he gon' wreck you not
Pass me the satin loc so I can wet my throat
While I sag the blue khakis with the Raider coat
All the hoes really want is gangstas just like us
Rough and don't give a fuck—ain't that right, Kurupt?
I stay bangin' on these niggas on a regular basis
Big paper chases, facin' felony cases
Made it to be famous, livin' hard and dangerous
Steppin' on these bustas in my blue Chuck Taylor's

You know that gangstas rock, gangstas roll
Here's the gangsta shit, we on a gangsta stroll
'Cause gangstas ride, gangstas slide
In the gangsta ride with the gangsta glide
'Cause gangstas move and gangstas groove
Most gangstas got nothin' to lose
Gangstas live, and gangstas die
Gangstas form a gang and the gang multiply
Gangstas give a fuck, a G don't ask why
Gangstas don't snitch, and gangstas don't cry
Gangstas boogie, gangstas don't dance
Gangsta pull the strap out yo' pants and blast
Gangstas don't run and gangstas don't hide
I'm a gangsta-ass nigga from the sick Southside
That's how I know exactly what a gangsta do
You love the gangsta shit, ain't you a gangsta too?
Then C-Walk, homie!

Would you say, I'm a little out of touch?
It’s my fault, I know, and I'll never get told enough
Let it go, or it's gonna tear me up
Send me right back home, California ain’t cold enough

[Pre-Chorus]
But there ain't no, good time, to sit and reminisce

And only want more of these in my life, oh

Drinking 40's in the park and running from headlights
We weren't fools
We just had nothing to lose

Left my sense alone, and it never caught up to me

We weren't fools
We just had nothing to lose
Walking straight in a direction that leads nowhere
Drunk as ever's always better when you don't care
We weren't fools
We just had nothing to lose

[Bridge]
Oh, one more time is all I want
I'm never gon' take my mind off all of this
And maybe some of us are growing up
Or maybe we're moving on that's all it is
That's all it is, oh

Woo!

[Verse 1]
You wake up
It’s raining and it’s Monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Time’s up
You’re late again, so get out the door (Out the door)
Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance-floor

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But when the lights go down, it’s the ending of the show (Show)
And you’re feeling like you got nowhere to go
Don’t you know...

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that’s just the way it goes
You can say ""goodbye,"" and you can say ""hello""
But you’ll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
You’ll always find your way back home

[Verse 2]
Your best friends, your little hometown
Are waiting up wherever you go now
You know that you can always turn around (Turn around)
'Cause this world is big and it’s crazy (It's crazy)
And this girl is thinking that maybe
This life is what some people dream about (Dream about)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause when I’m feeling down and I am all alone
(And I am all alone)
I’ve always got a place where I can go
'Cause I know...

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that’s just the way it goes
You can say “goodbye,” and you can say “hello”
But you’ll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams (Chase your dreams)
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows (Everybody knows)
You’ll always find your way back home

[Bridge]
Where they know exactly who you are
Back home, where the real you is the superstar
Back home, you know it’s never too far away

[Breakdown]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that’s just the way it goes
You can say “goodbye,” and you can say “hello”
But you’ll always find your way back

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that’s just the way it goes (that’s just the way it goes)
You can say “goodbye,” and you can say “hello” (Say “hello”)
But you’ll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows (Everybody knows)
You’ll always find your way back home

Veel mannen maken herrie, dat is vreemd
En ik heb 't gezien, daarom ben je niet the same
Het leven gaat te snel, je bent heavy in die race
Woede in je body, maar lijkt happy in je face
Op zoek naar die ruimte, maar toch heb je niet die space
't Is niet elke dag feest

Maar ik count m'n blessings, secure the bag

2 borden, 1 tafel
Maakt niet uit welke weg we bewandelen
Als we aan het einde van de dag onze doelen maar behalen
En aankomen waar we willen zijn
In het leven hebben we meerdere keuze
Maar aan het einde van de dag is het belangrijk dat we doen wat goed voelt
Doen waar we voor staan
Wat zijn onze woorden zonder onze daden?
Zonder input geen uitkomst
Zeg me, wat is een idee als je er aan het einde van de dag niets mee doet?"

Potevo essere un tossico morto (Oh)
Invece sono un tossico ricco (Ah)
A quarant'anni squaglio il disco d'oro (Ah)
Ma non è mica detto che ci arrivo (Ah, ah, ah)
Tu mi dici: ""Accanna a stare in strada"" (Stare in strada, uh)
Io t'ho detto: ""Accanna co' 'sta lagna"" (Co' 'sta lagna, yah, ehi)

Sporchi ricordi sporcano l'iride, sulla scena del crimine
Un quadro di Giotto il disagio del G8 non può descrivere
Oh, mettimi una cimice nell'ombelico come Neo
Spero sia Dio che creda in noi e non che a lui ci creda io
Uh, Ryan, fottimi, bambina, non è mai tardi (Mai)
Occhio a quei ciottoli, erezione da eruzione come vulcani
Ore con in testa il suo nome
Mi augura la morte, poi vuol fare l'amore
In strada indagan il GIP e la madama
Qui Ketama (
Yah
) e Tedua, criniera da savana
Nello schermo della TV pippo strisce delle tigri
Sei stato avvisato, fra', uomo mezzo salvato, ammoniti
Tu e il tuo crew siete puah, vi facciamo a pois
Belzebù, nel girone con Caronte
Salta su questo groove, il timone messo a prua
Love Bandana, non la gang tua (Pah, pah, Tedua,

Don't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure

You rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothing left

Astronaut

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?

When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy

When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah

She say that I'm cool (Damn straight)
I'm like, ""Yeah, that's true"" (That's true)
I believe in G-O-D (Ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb, uh (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool, but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)

[Bridge]
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

He wakes her up and lay her clothes out and packs her lunch
Got to rush to catch the school bus
Pony tails and tooth brush
Sometimes it seems its too much he waves good bye
Then he sighs 12 he days and barely gettin by
Her momma workin 3rd shift and
He hope she ain't back gettin high
On a slippery slope slowly slippin to a pit
Hanging on for dear life loosing grip but he refused to quit

[Aaron Lewis:]
I see the look in your eyes and I know how you feel
Work your fingers to the bone just to cover the bills
You want to leave that single wide trailer in the holler for a house up on a hill
You don't care how they feel
Cause the struggle is real
I know the struggle is real

[Struggle Jennings:]
She's almost 40 and still dancin on that brass pole
Customers are disrespectful, manager is an asshole
Her greater goals over shadow all the sorrows
5 am will take forever few more minutes till tomorrow
Not enough dollars in their garder for their house of dreams
Running to the dressin room slams the door and starts to scream
We're she wants to be in life is still a distant image
At her wits end still isn't finished story has an ending

[Aaron Lewis:]
I see the look in your eyes and I know how you feel
Work your fingers to the bone just to cover the bills
You want to leave that single wide trailer in the holler for a house up on a hill
You don't care how they feel
Cause the struggle is real
I know the struggle is real

[Struggle Jennings:]
He walks outside and throws his tools in to his pickup truck
Looks up and smiles see her Altima is pulling up
Her weight is lifted, her doors open and he knows she sober
He grabs aholdst her she finds comfort underneath his shoulder
As they embrace all of their worries are erased
Because together they can face all of obstacles in place
Pulls out of the holler to go make a honest dollar
Pay dues won't loose smile through the blues of blue collar

[Aaron Lewis:]
I see the look in your eyes and I know how you feel
Work your fingers to the bone just to cover the bills
You want to leave that single wide trailer in the holler for a house up on a hill
You don't care how they feel
Cause the struggle is real
I know the struggle is real

I see the look in your eyes and I know just how you feel
Work your fingers to the bone just to cover the bills
You want to leave that single wide trailer in the holler for a house up on a hill
You don't care how they feel
Cause the struggle is real
I know the struggle is real"

Something about you escapes me
I've lost my charm
Something about me is see-through
I can't do no more harm
Anymore

I can take the dizzy daydreams
I think they are fine
But I'm not used to dealing with feeling like I'm wasting your time
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
And suddenly I'm not interested in whatever the rest of the world has to offer so
I drown facedown in my head and feel my state start to alter 'cause you
Because you

[Verse 3]
I can try to shake off the stupid
'Cause it shouldn't be that hard
But when I start movin'
I begin to think about your stars
Oh

[Bridge]
And it's not like I'm not familiar with dullin' myself to tepid
But I've never cared so much about avoiding overstepping
And when I think about you I forget about my hands
And all I hear are dancing girls and snapping rubber bands
And you don't know what that means

[Chorus]
But I'm suddenly not interested in whatever the rest of the world has to offer so
Despite my ticks and buzzes
I'll listen to you whenever you're feeling low
Promise I won't interrupt 'cause
My breath ends up catching whenever I hear you speak
Endlessly try to make you smile 'cause
Whenever I see it my knees always get so
Weak

[Verso 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
¿Te digo en qué pienso
Mientras  voy con prisa hacia ti, nena?
Si  me demoro, me disculpo
Sé gentil, aunque me gusta lo rudo también
Ya hablamos suficiente
Tómate  tu tiempo, diviértete
Llámame  cuando estés sola
Llámame cuando necesites a alguien
Haces  esto por mí porque soy tu hombre, lo nuestro es especial
Y te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí

[Coro: Ari Lennox & Ty Dolla $ign]
Te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Y yo te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Te  cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí (Yeah)
Te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Y yo te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Te cuidaré, cuídame tú a mí

[Verso 2: Ari Lennox]
¿De quién quieres amor?
¿Quién más puede tan fácilmente hacer todo tan bien?
Llámame cuando me necesites
Hay más perras, sí, no les tengo nada en contra
Pero ninguna como yo
¿De quién quieres amor?
¿Quién más puede tan fácilmente hacer todo tan bien?
Llámame cuando me necesites
Hay más perras, sí, no les tengo nada en contra
Pero ninguna como yo

[Coro: Ari Lennox & Ty Dolla $ign]
Te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Y yo te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí (Yeah)
Te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Y yo te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Te cuidaré, cuídame tú a mí

[Verso 3: Omen]
El destino me ha sido infiel
He tenido por qué alegrarme y por qué llorar
Sentí como que me gané la lotería cuando llegaste a mí
Sé que aunque eres refinada
Tú también has pasado por lo tuyo, pero aún tienes tu orgullo
Puedo mostrarte todo de mí
Puedo ser quién soy cerca de ti
No hay nada qué esconder, sé que te gusta boca abajo
Como si estuvieras noqueada
Y sí te dejaré desorientada, te daré todo de mí
Soy de buen corazón y los de buen corazón duramos más
En la cama te revuelco buscando cómo acomodarnos
Eres lo mejor que tengo, espero que estés ahí para mí
Posa para mí, tu piel es tan sedosa
Si les dijera todo de ti, admirarían tanto como yo
Tu presencia
Eres dulce para mis ojos, quizá tengo una obsesión
Y hay cosas que comparto contigo y con mis amigos no
Llámame para que pase el rato contigo
Conocerás únicamente el placer
Cuídame, yo te cuidaré a ti

[Coro: Ari Lennox & Ty Dolla $ign]
Te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Y yo te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí (Yeah)
Te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Y yo te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí
Te cuidaré si me cuidas tú a mí

[Verso 4: Dreezy]
Abrázame más fuerte si ves que me tropiezo (Yeah)
Empecemos a olvidar todo (Empecemos)
Pasé por todo lo malo que llegó con buenas intenciones (De verdad)
Eres mi terapia, sabes cómo hablar y cuándo escucharme
A tu amor no le afecta cuánto cambia mi apariencia
Te cuidaré
Mis miedos me sabotean, pero avanzaré contigo (No les presté atención)
Estaba bien antes, simplemente es mejor contigo (Me gusta eso)
Sabes que bromeo cuando te digo que ya fue suficiente
Puedo ver tu compromiso y yo soy el mejor partido por aquí (Una perra mala)
Y a ti te gusta que yo haga lo mío, sea independiente y fina
¿Por qué no vienes y me concedes unas rondas? (Mira)
Me gusta que me trates igual sin importar con quién estés
Y es lindo verte celoso, pero si otro se pasa de listo soy capaz de asesinarlo
Agarra mis sábanas, el sexo te hará rechinar los dientes
¿Cómo llegué a tu casa? No estaba pensando bien (Estaba drogada)
Hago mis locuras contigo, me tienes empapada
Sabes que cualquier chantaje es mentira (Mentiras)
Si estás necesitado, sabes que tienes que llamarme (Llámame)
Amor, sexo o dinero, mierda, quiero los tres (Quiero todo)
No me arrepiento de mi elección y soy bastante exigente (Lo soy)
Si otra te pregunta con quién estás, sabes que solamente estoy yo (Dreezy)"

Dile que bailando te conocí, cuéntale
Dile que esta noche me quieres ver, cuéntale
Cuéntale que beso mejor que él, cuéntale
Dile que esta noche tú me va' a ver, cuéntale

Cuéntale que te conocí bailando
Cuéntale, que soy mejor que él
Cuéntale, que te traigo loca
Cuéntale, que no lo quieres ver
Cuéntale que te conocí bailando
Cuéntale, que soy mejor que él
Cuéntale, que te traigo loca
Cuéntale, que no lo quieres ver

[Verso 2]
Que quizás fue la noche la que te traicionó
O el perfume de mi piel lo que te cautivó
Que ya no tiene' excusa' pa' tu traición
Que tuviste mil motivos, que entre en razón
Que quizás te hablo al oído como ya él no
O en mí arde el fuego de la pasión
Ya no le mientas más y admite tu error
Y si es por mí no pidas perdón
Digo, queda de ti el que lo perdones
El que lo olvides o lo abandones
Porque con llorar no se compone
Entonces a mí dame otra noche

[Coro]
Otra, otra noche, otra (Ay, que yo no te boté)
Otra, otra noche, otra (Aunque tú vuelvas con él)

You talk art, but maybe stop cause you sound like a fool
When you first moved to town you had has wrapped around
Your finger like the ring you're hiding now

No me importa lo que digan los demás

I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

[Chorus : B.B. King]
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

[Verse 3: Bono]
Ran into a juke-joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazed and in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side

A life lived without direction

I'm hoping that I'll find my way

Out here I'll find myself
I am who i choose to be
Not somebody else

A moment lost in time
A life we failed to find

I turn back on myself again
Directionless I am
The compass inside my head
Has left me lost again

I'm tearing at the seams
I'm hoping that I'll find my way
I'll find my way

I looked up to the sky at night
(The sky at night)
I finally felt alive
(I felt alive)
One breath that had set me free
A first step to be more than me
I found a place i could call my home
A new life to make my own

I managed to fix myself
With decency over wealth
I'd found a better way

I'm tearing at the seams

I'll find.. i'll found..

I'm tearing at the seams
I'm hoping that I'll find my way

What's up?
Yo, this scene, rollers tried to jack a nigga 'cause a nigga with a pearl rollin' on a Coupé with goldens
Yo, man, what's up?
This riding motherfucker, jack me at rollin' 'round bumping ’cause music's too loud, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, this is P-O to the G-O
Motherfuckin' cop just jacked me 'cause I was drinking beer in Mill Valley
What's up, man?
Aight, man, fuck 'em

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I don't give a fuck
They done pushed me to my limit, I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
And now I'm in the back on the paddy wagon
While this cop's bragging about the nigga he's jackin'
I see no justice, all I see is niggas dyin' fast
The sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse pass
Just another day in the life, G
Gotta step lightly 'cause cops tried to snipe me
The cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man
But damn near have an accident to pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my check
I get more respect from the motherfuckin' dope man
The Grammys and American Music shows
They pimp us like hoes, take our dough, but they hate us, though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck tryin' to get with these crooked-ass hypocrites
The way they see it, we was meant to be kept down
Just can't understand why we gettin' respect, now
Mama told me there'd be days like this
But I'm pissed 'cause it stays like this
And now they're trying to ship me off to Kuwait?
Give me a break, how much shit can a nigga take?
I ain't going nowhere, no how
Bush wanna throw down?
You better bring the gun, pal
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailing hay, I better spray with an AK
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
From the motherfuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
'Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a psychopath
But you sit and laugh before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who do you think? A motherfuckin' 90's nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up, I had enough
(Yeah) And I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Pogo]
Nigga, it ain't just the blacks
It's also a gang of motherfuckers dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and they attitude is shitty
So, tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
They say we niggas like to do niggas
So me and a cop are just two niggas
A street-walkin' nigga and a beat-walkin' nigga
With a badge, I end his future and his past
With a blast, take his cash before I dash, I bash his head in
Dump him at the dead end and that's just his luck
'Cause a nigga like P don't really give a fuck

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?
They act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit, ain't this a bitch?
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere, but where?
’Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if he knows that my income
Is more than his pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mack? In fact, who's the blackjack?
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's gettin' over
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova
And count another quick mill'
I'm getting paid for my trade, but I'm still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up, niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your blacks up
But the cops getting dropped by the gunshot
Used to come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers, stay strong, keep your heads up
They know we fed up
But they just don't give a fuck
Yeah, they just don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck either, man)

[Outro: 2Pac]
I gotta give my fuck offs
Fuck you to the San Francisco Police Department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff's Department
Fuck you to the FBI
Fuck you to the CIA
Fuck you to the B-U-S-H
Fuck you to the Ameri-K-K-Ka
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudice motherfuckers

Sie gibt Arsch für meinen Nam'n, null Moral
Nein, ich geh’ nicht fremd, sie macht’s nur oral
Du hast fünfhundert PS, doch kommst null voran (Ahh)

Sie will nicht mehr geh’n, sagt, sie bleibt, weil ich lebe dieses Life (Ja)
Kann sie nicht mehr seh'n, weil sie redet die ganze Zeit

And that ass wit' you, got my dick as hard as a missile
Don't hop on top, cause I ride around with a pistol
If they pull us over, I'll be out of town with an issue
If you was mine, I'd introduce you to mama girl
You're stylin' in your boots and Gabbana, I'm so used to your Prada
I take trips cause out in Houston it's hotter
Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Make my jewels and my collar
You had me feelin' like a fool when I hollered
Tryin' to squeeze in but you wasn't bothered
Now I ain't neither, soon as I realized that I ain't need her
She in a rush to get close to me but I ain't eager
Shiit...

[Chorus: Avant]
I am, the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright
I'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand
I'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man
I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Look I don't mean to bother you
But your sex appeal is remarkable
You make a G wanna walk around in park with you
There ain't no tellin' the kind of things I'mma start to do
If I get wrapped up on your ass too fast
I could tell you feel the same cause when I asked you laughed
So I'mma leave it at that, take a hint and put in my math
I imagine, you probably look twice as good in the bath
And I'm buggin' cause I can see you right in the hood when I pass
I'm never stable cause business is on my ass
But you could be the one that I visit before I dash
And I admit, I've been the type to hit and split
But you can't blame me for the females that I been gettin' with
'Cause, most of these broads has had they eyes on my grit
To the eager shit, and learned to be satisfied with the dick
And, if you ain't worth it that's all you get
I ain't gon' blame you, I'm gon' blame all you tricks 'cause

[Chorus: Avant]
I am, the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright
I'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand
I'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man
I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
It seems like your attitude, only appears when I'm mad at you
When several situations occur and that includes
When I'm gone too long, ridin' through them avenues
As soon as I get home there's rumors and scattered news
You know my fantasies, am I feelin' things or can this be
Your girlfriend tryin' to sandwich me
My heart's colder than sandwich meat
'Cause I, come from the hood where the hammers be
I move fast with a switch pace
And pop a Listerine strip in, before you get all up in a bitch face
Movin' your body like this
Gon' make me blow like a bottle of Crist'
Man I don't know no one hotter than Twist
You got my temperature risin'
From your hips and your thighs and
And that glare in your eyes'll brighten up a horizon
It comes naturally, I don't bribe 'em
It's as easy as one, two, three and I slide in

[Chorus: Avant]
I am, the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright
I'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand
I'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man
I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah, yeah
I am, the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright
I'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand
I'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man

Darling, I've been working all week (yeah)

I'll pick you up after and-

We'll hit the coast on the late night
Make love 'til daylight

I've been running circles 'round a night that never ends
I've been chasing heartache, in a city and a friend
I've been with you so long, even seen you lose it, but, who cares?
Racing down the bowery, on a crowded afternoon
Dripping from the downpour of your insecure typhoon
Can you even want me, or this is just a way to keep you safe?

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?

Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?
I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend
I can make you think, everybody wants to be your friend

Drinking with your cell phone with a smile on your face
Happy in success, but still a thousand miles away
Is this what you wanted, is this everything you had in store?

Que se preparen pa' la fiesta
Que la cintura darle vela
Ma', pégate al frente y que suba esa tela
Que esto está afinca'o hasta que a ti te duela
Tú eres mi bebé, no te me salgas de al frente
Báilalo fuerte ¿qué importa la gente?
Algarete, no importa la gente
To' eso es pa' mí, bailando te di fuete
No hay más na', te diré
Y esto no para hasta que estés sin conciencia
Que quite la paciencia y te sueltes las piernas

Ella pide que la toque, a veces que la bese
Me manda razones, que cuando amanece
Está bien encendía, te tengo en la mira
Fiera de noche, una santa de día
Baby, el ritmo se adueña de tu piel
A ti te gusta y a mí también
Que nos pasemos las noches dándole
Baby, el ritmo se adueña de tu piel
A ti te gusta y a mí también
Que nos pasemos las noches dándole

Báilalo, no, no tengas miedo
Tienes la verde pa' que lo sigas sin límite

Vamo' hacerlo sin perce, sin perce

Sólo tiene que moverte y encenderte

There’s nowhere to run and you’re down to the wire
Remember that you still a rider, still a rider
Still a survivor, a sole survivor!
Remember that you're still a rider, still a rider
And that's all I ever been known to be

Ready in case they bang on me try to plug and put a blood stain on me
If it go down in history nigga don't forget to label me

Even though we struggling trying find ways to double it
Cuz in the hood nigga we bubbling
Funny how people love it when our community is crumbling
If you keep up on stumbling
We'll end up under that shoveling

Remember that you're still a rider, still a rider

Been in and out of state getting that money
Trying they best just find their family
No matter what hustle going
We'll find a way to get up on it
Gotta put that muscle on it
Stand on the corner till the morning
Rider
Like everybody in the hood
Did it when nobody thought you could
I see you my nigga whats good gripping leather and wood
9 mille hidden under the hood
Get the rich and give to the pour
Like a modern day Robin Hood

I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, dazed and kinda lonely

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missin' you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my day time
Loosen up their frown, make 'em feel alive
I make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy

[Verse 1]
Do the right thing, not talking about a black or white thing
'Cause that will cause conflict to make this shit legit
But your definition of legit and illegitimate
Is confusion, now the Redhead wanna set
To make things clearer, 'cause in about a year or two
What you do is take a look up in the mirror
And what you see is the image of hate
That you shed upon the others or sisters and the brothers
Now in my opinion you need someone to teach
The whole world is acting like a giant Howard Beach
I asked my man victor, what he used to do for fun
He said he learned to shoot a gun before the age of 21
Crime and abortion, all kinds of mind distortion
This is very important but just a little caution
Of what you can do, here's a clue and it's true, yo
Don't wanna burn your sweater or make your life better
And do the right thing

[Chorus]
(Do the right thing) You got to do the right thing
(Do the right thing) Do the right thing
(Do the right thing) You got to do the right thing
(Do the right thing, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Brothers are stealin' and dealin' and big wheelin'
And to a younger mind that stuff is appealin'
So what do they do, they gather up a crew
Go out and steal and rob instead of gettin' a job
Now your mother tried to bring you up better than that
The same way she loved you you loved her right back
But now you think you're grown and you argue a lot
Over money you got from dealin' stuff on the block
Now you're not the only one in the world that has problems
Keep your head straight and you can surely solve them
Be a fly guy and reach sky high
And like the Jeffersons you get a piece of the pie
I hope you take heed to the message I brought
In other words: the lesson I taught
The Redhead kick a lyric but I won't sing
And the FBI Crew wants you, and you and you to do the right thing

[Chorus]
(Do the right thing) You got to do the right thing
(Do the right thing) Do the right thing
(Do the right thing) You got to do the right thing
(Do the right thing, yeah)

[Bridge]
Right about we want all the squaders and the homeboys in the house to help me
Count it off as we go a little something like this
One, two, three
And Manhattan, you gotta do the right thing
Brooklyn, you got ta do the right thing (""Ah yeah"")
And the Bronx you got ta do the right thing
Queens Island, you got to do the right thing (""Ah yeah"")
Long Island, you gotta do the right thing
Staten Island, you gotta do the right thing (""Ah yeah"")
On the West Coast, you gotta do the right thing
Everybody, everybody in the world, you got to do the right thing
Do the right thing (""Check this out"")
(""Ah yeah"")
Do the right thing (""Check this out"")
(""Ah yeah"")
Do the right thing

[Chorus]
(Do the right thing) You got to do the right thing
(Do the right thing) Do the right thing
(Do the right thing) You got to do the right thing
(Do the right thing)

[Interlude]
The Redhead One sendin' out a message on a positive note
Try to make you all see the light when we're supposed to be in the dark
You know, this is goin' out to my mother, to my brother
To the rest of the FBI tribe
And you know what I'm sayin'
Everybody else in the world
I just want y'all to do one thing
And that's the right thing

[Outro]
(Do the right thing) You got to do the right thing
(Do the right thing) Do the right thing
(Do the right thing) You got to do the right thing

It's that fiend with 'bout twenty prescriptions
Down for my triple six killers
I glisten in my world of fiction, twitching from all my addictions
Mutilations deep down in my basement
Forsaken the road to heaven I had taken
Replacing my scriptures for demons and witches
While twistin' a cigarillo full of bitches and snitches
$-U-I-C-I-D-E
P-R-O-P-H-E-T

The blackest creep of the black sheep ($lick $loth)

I reek from the mice I eat
I am the fiend for the shrines and sheets
I am the tide, and yes, I am the deep!
G-R-E-Y-F-I-V-E-N-I-N-E
I am the skeleton hiding the bones I need
I am the leopard print that Lucifer uses for hide and seek
Enemies try and see me, but I'm quite the freak
Hiding inside misery, yeah, my spine's so weak
Frying my memory with all the pine I breathe
Scythe in a sheath, I will slice all the sheep
Because Christ is on ice, I'm collecting the blood he bleeds

Ain't nothin' but the funk, baby!

I need a peace of mind, I'm stressed out today
It's about that time to make that get away
Dealing with the people I deal with everyday
Got to find a place I can hide away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I can be away from the madness
Far from the noise and the darkness
It's not too late, there's gotta be a way
For me to escape all this nonsense
Get away

Yo check the groove
B's kicking a flow
Real smooth
E double S-S
With some cess
And it's a necessity to move
So hit it where ya fit in and let the rythm snatch ya
Throw a good rhyme so watch what's coming at ya
As I release another Brown batch of jams
That slam
And you can't touch so scram
I know you cram to understand
Who I am, damn by the way can I please get this dance?
Let's not free lance 'cause I'm just getting started
Believe me that was nothing but a Brown party
That's going on and got it going on
Bob and Ted'd rated number one so flow on it
And if you're in the house, pump your fists and say
Ho! (Ho!)
Say ho, ho! (Ho, ho!)
Ted, bring me on back, bring me on back
Dance!
There it is, oh!

[Chorus]
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away

Never in my life
Have I ever felt that something just ain't right
Baby
Baby
Tired of all this mess
Unhapiness
I guess it's I just gotta get away
Gotta get away

I don't wanna hurt nobody

Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Please somebody
It just don't feel right
Baby I can't sleep at night
I need a peace of mind
Far away from the darkness
And you know it's
I need someone
To take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away baby
Please B Brown is outta here

Me extrañas

Que no puedes apreciarme
Porque ya no estaré ahí (Natti Nat, Natti Nat)
Así de fácil
Ya no estaré ahí
¿Qué será de ti?

Ahora te das cuenta de tu realidad
Que sin mi no eres na'
Tienes tu vida desorganiza’ (-organiza')
Te sientes como basura

De que en tu vida yo era la dura, pa'
Sé que extraña la noche de travesura, pa’
Poder tocarme sin ninguna censura

Y pensar que tuviste que perder
Para aprenderme a valorar
Pero ya no hay na' que valorar

Y ahora que me ofreces hasta las nubes
Ya yo no quiero na'

Que te pusiera' pa' mí (Pa' mí)
Pero ya pasó el tiempo
Y me tengo que ir

Que te pusieras pa' mí (Pa' mí)
Pero ya pasó el tiempo

[Verso 3]
Toa’ las veces que fallaste y yo lo sé (Yo lo sé)
Toa’ las veces que me fuiste infiel (Infiel)
También sé que de mi cuerpo
Sigues teniendo sed (Sed)
Pero, tenerme como me tenías
Ahora se quedará en fantasía
Tanto que tu madre te lo decía
Valora esa niña, que algún día la puedes perder

There was nothing to make believe
And the songs that we sang
They were written for you and me
Melodies on repeat
That's what I hear when you're by my side (Ooh)
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side (Ooh)

Well, when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul

You're worth a leap of faith

De las tentaciones que yo tengo
Juraría que eres la mejor
Yo prefiero que me parta un beso que negarte el corazón

[Pre-Coro: Alejandro Sanz]
Malditas las ganas que tengo de verte
Y que lluevas sobre mi desierto
Hay entre los dos una cuenta pendiente
¿Qué te parece si arreglamos eso?

[Coro: Paty Cantú y Alejandro Sanz]
Ay tómame, llevame un ratito al paraiso
Ponme las estrellas en el piso
No hace falta tanto compromiso, sin compromiso
Acuerdate que tengo la mente peligrosa
Y esta noche que te ves como una diosa
Se está poniendo buena la cosa, ay, la cosa

[Post-Coro: Ambos]
Me gusta, me gusta
Tú tienes algo que me gusta
Me gusta, me gusta

Quitate la pena y perdón, pero primero la camisa

We come together to make this paper, gone show you
How it's going down for the 9-9 baby, like this

[E.S.G.]
Picture me balling while I be crawling in a hummer
See I be's a fool boy that's why I brought out my toy for the summer
Rolling my wineberry red, T.V.s behind my head
Since I signed down with Wreckshop, got all them haters scared
Now boppers turn they head when they see me popped up on fo's
Gray insides or buckhide with my suicide doors
Cop five G's a show, dropped two ki's of snow
Saran wrapped it in plastic so the F-E-D's won't know
Young nigga my dick hang low, so bitches watch this man wreck
You can blame it on the barre or the dame Xanax
Bumping our benz, blue lens, twenties spin I'm flexing
South Park, break jaws like Marshall Law do on Tekken
Wreckshop and Swishahouse wrecking, they say that can't nobody stop us
Nigga we bail in V-12, with a gray pieces on the bottom
Underground tapes, we drop em, button bladez we chop em
E.S.G. and Slim Thug so look here cuz you can't knock it

Now when I come down I be blowing up the north
And when I come down I be chucking up the south
Swishahouse and Wreckshop don't stop, body rocking in the drop
Slim Thug and E.S.G., riding on threes bleeding the block
Say what, the boppers bop, and uh, the choppers chop
Swishahouse and Wreckshop not uh, we can't be stopped

Well it's the Mr. Slim Thug straight off the north or down south
See I floss, big body boss and represent Swishahouse
Live on top top on my city and I sit on top of 4-4's
I stay on top of my game, and lay on top of these hoes
I be cocked up on three, from Homestead to G.C
It's R.I.P. to P-A-T cause ain't no plexing by me
See Slim and E.S.G., stay playa made and get paid
On the north with Gucci shades and keep a fresh set of braids
From Gulf Bank to Cavalcade the north side ride pride
See I'm loud on buck eyed as my drop top glide
No we can't be denied, cause it's the Swishahouse time
For 9-8 got on the grind and 9-9 I'ma shine
The north and south done put it down, it's R.I.P. to all plex
We'd rather roll fresh, G.S. Lexs with baguettes on our necks
Ain't nothing but playas in Houston Tex, whether we got braids or fades
Cause it don't matter where you from long as you trying to get paid

(Chorus)

[E.S.G.]
45 south, the interstate, get the weight the pyrex shake
Trunk shake, break a scrap plate off that 2-88

[Slim Thug]
And I'm, flossing off on that I-45
With Mario on my side, playing 9-9 Live

Candy spray on top of the grey, ball and parlay we playa made
We be shining, piece full of diamonds, reclining with a razor fade

[Slim Thug]
It's that Homestead till I'm dead, where boys ain't scared to go fed
Roll candy blue and that red, with zig-zags in our head

[E.S.G.]
We drop the screen niggas, we looking clean niggas
We gripping grain, swang and bang from South Main to Martin Luther King niggas

[Slim Thug]
From 5th Ward to Acres Home, is where I roam
Where them thugs bout it, bout it got they hand on the chrome

Como una espina de rosa cuando yo te vi con otra
Fue lo que sentí, te quiero pa' mí
Ere' una calle rota, serpiente venenosa
Anoche soñé que estabas aquí
Well, I got a feeling these scars won't ever look like they're old news
If I let you keep on rubbin' salt into all my open wounds
I wish I could keep everything that you took of me but the photos
But you keep a piece of me locked in a secret spot we called home

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

She's got eyes of the bluest skies

Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

I believed
Every word you didn't say
Now I see
You're only gonna break me down

[Chorus]
If you wanna say something
Man up, don't say nothing
Oh, I speak the truth
If you wanna say something
Silence don't mean nothing
But it does to you
How did silence become a part of you?

[Bridge]
No, I'm not on my knees, begging for you
For you to comfort me, no, I don't want that
Just needed your honesty, but all I want now
Is for you to speak to me like you never did

[Chorus]
If you wanna say something
Man up, don't say nothing
Oh, I scream the truth
If you wanna say something
Silence don't mean nothing
But it does to you
If you wanna say something
Man up, don't say nothing
Oh, I scream the truth

[Outro]
If you wanna say something
Silence don't mean nothing
But it does to you
Now, the silence is part of me and you"

She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

There's a warm wind a-blowin'
And a burnin' sun droppin' down
At the end of time I'll be rockin'
In a wooden chair like I'm still starin' at a crowd
'Cause this road I've traveled has been long and full of heartache
But the heartache's gone when nobody's around
When them Hollywood lights all go dim and California looks like a dead town
You know where I'll be found

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'll be the ghost on a hilltop overlookin' plains
With the coal smoke steady rollin' off of that train
And my songs will always live down in the country (Country)
Where that young boy livin' for a Friday night
Plays an old lost song through the radio dial
When the words from the past speak up so loud (Speak up so loud)
Yeah, that's the voice, that's the voice, that's the voice
The voice from a legend in the south (In the south)

[Verse 2]
When I'm fifty years old I'll be on my back porch
Smokin' me a fuckin' stogie about the size of a torch
Gettin' pulled to rock music that's vibratin' the place
'Til the neighbors call the police on my dirty white ass
Yeah, I figured you thought this was the talkin' blues
Yeah, it's talkin' blues just in my shit-kick boots
I like to say stuff like 'fuck you' and some more
That's why you won't find my album at a Walmart store
Yeah, I'm the white horse that won't let nobody ride
No saddle for my back for the next half ass guy
Nobody yankin' my reins or stoppin' the go
I gallop with hooves courted in forty-niner gold
Yeah, I'm the cheap ugly mutt that's faster than the million dollar quarter horse
And there ain't no catchin' me, it's a no go
I so grown into bein' the old soul so this soul goes
And the time ain't fadin' not none of my fuckin' vocals

I'll be the ghost on a hilltop overlookin' plains
With the coal smoke steady rollin' off of that train

Yeah, that's the voice, that's the voice, that's the voice
The voice from a legend in the south

[Bridge]
Well I'm obsessed with trucks and cars way too loud
Dump women if they don't like country sounds
Like Elvis, Johnny Cash, and a little bit of Waylon Jennings
(You know that's true)
I still sip well water right out of the hose
Smoke so much weed that my eyes are closed
I write songs fucked up like I'm kin to old George Jones
(Old George Jones)
Yeah, most the time I'm higher than a kite
And my arms are wings and I'm takin' flight
And don't plan on stoppin' 'til I run outta gas or crash
(That'd be bad)
Yeah, my tattoos look like absolute shit
And my teeth are crooked as a crackhead's chin
But my knuckles still feel like a boat, built Ford Tough
(For me it's enough)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'll be the ghost on a hilltop overlookin' plains
With the coal smoke steady rollin' off of that train
And my songs will always live down in the country

Soldiers passing by

[Pre-Chorus: Edward Maya]
I came to see you, but I just might go overboard tonight
I came to see you, but I might go inside
I think I found the one that'll hold my heart
I wanna feel your heart, we're in love tonight

[Chorus: Edward Maya]
I can fix all those lies
Oh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby, I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I"

Girl, you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playin' with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever, baby, you just see

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

[Pre-Chorus: Wanyá Morris]
When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try, I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

[Chorus: All]
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, mmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

[Pre-Chorus: Wanyá Morris]
Will you love me again like you loved me before?
This time, I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me, don't let me down, oh

Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat all night (Maybe I'll forgive you, baby)
Just like you did, baby, but that's alright
Heh, I love you anyway (Maybe you'll try)
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day, baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby (We should be happy together forever)
'Cause you just won't come back to me (You and I)
Will you? Just come back to me (Yeah, yeah)

Yo, the sun don't shine forever (
You can turn the track up a little bit for me
)
But as long as it's here, then we might as well shine together (All up in my ears)
Better now than never, business before pleasure (The mic is loud, but the music isn't loud)
P. Diddy and the fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight (Yeah)
So when you hear somethin', make sure you hear it right
Don't make an ass outta yourself by assumin' (Yeah, now the mic is low now, turn the mics up some more)
Our music keeps you moving, what are you proving? (Turn that shit all the way up, yeah)
You know that I'm two levels above you, baby (Music's getting louder)
Hug me, baby, I'ma make you love me, baby (
This shit hot
)
Talkin' crazy ain't gon' get you nuthin' but choked (Uh-huh)
And that jealousy is only gon' leave you broke (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
So the only thing left now is God for these cats (It's going the fuck down now)
And B.I.G., you know we too hard for these cats
I'ma win 'cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (
Uh
), you raking up plaques

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of Satan, they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin' your fam
Destiny lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the Izz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a few cars (A few cars)
And I kick a few flows so I could pick a few hoes (A few hoes)
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm quick to bust if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matos, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows (Castro)
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killing shit
Oops, Cristal keep spilling, shit, you overdid it, holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie, baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like 
Jurassic
Park
 did, quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me, the underboss
Of this holocaust, truly yours, Frank White

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?

[Verse 3: Diddy]
Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later, dawg, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go Platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny? Only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin' on your tape or CD
The Billboard killer, no team iller
The Fam-o, ammo is every channel
We been hot for a long time, burning like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
'Cause I tell it how it is and you tell it how it might be

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two miras
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect, squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped in the coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacing him
Niggas step up, we just macin' them, placin' them
In funerals, criminals turned aroused to Brick City
Nobody come off like P. Diddy (P. Diddy)
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
We spray men (Ha), I position competition
Another day in the life of the commission

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Diddy]
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back (Ayo, can y'all hear me out there?)
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at? (Ayo, turn me up, nobody can hear me out there)
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back (That's good, it's all fucked up now)
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at? (Y'all know it's all fucked up now, right?)
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back (What the fuck I'ma do now?)
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at? (What I'ma do now?)
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at? (Can y'all hear me out there?)
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?

He started off as a young man with a heart of gold
A pure soul, but somewhere down the line, he lost control (Why?)
And I don't know, maybe the struggles seemed never endin' (Yeah)
We all experience, but only few comprehend it
You go through it to get to it, that's what the business is
The difference is, no matter what, you finish it
Treat it as innocence except for jail sentences
A song for when he's gone is all we have in his remembrance (Yo)
A couple more nights would have been nice
We all told him he was skatin' on thin ice
A black suit with the pin stripes, it has to be (Yeah)
That's what he wanted, I know, 'cause that was me

And if it was to you, I'm truthfully apologetic (I'm sorry)
You can't accept it, then God bless you, if not, forget it (Forget it)
'Cause I'm just tryin' to sweep my side of the street (You know)
A great man's buried deep down inside me that needs (Please)

So far from my past misfortune
No sleepin', late nights, no eatin'
Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona, I was 'round that corner
Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down Sawyer
When we slide, you won't see morning
Another story of a young Black man
Tryna make it up out that jam, Goddamn
Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans
If you hatin', don't shake my hand
Take it easy, homie

Of the 22 bus stop way back when
With the .22, 5 shot eyes on scan
For the click, clack, clap

It's funny, I was going crazy not too long ago
Women problems every morning like the Maury show
Swimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread from the sharks
Make me wanna put the hammer to my head
At the park politickin' with the kids
Tryna get 'em on a straight path, got the lames mad
Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation, conversations, what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss
Wanna be the boss? Then you gotta pay the cost
Learned it from the Dogg, I'm from Long Beach
That's the city where the skinny carry strong heat

Pa' todos esos
Que querían al Don C de los 2000’s de regreso

Ya no hago tiraderas porque no las necesito
Pregúntale a la doña, pregúntale al morrito
Pregúntale hasta al que no le gustaba el Rap, insisto
Es más, pregúntale a tu rapper favorito
Por el mejor rapero, fiero perro de esta tierra
¡C-Kan! El perro de todas esas perras
Y del otro que pita porque es miembro de la banda
Pues vengan pa' ponerles a este miembro de bufanda
Hello Kung Fu Panda, te saluda Scooby Doo
El que mandó a la quiebra a los maricas de tu crew
So you know how we do, ten tu plata carnalito
Acá eso vale gaver, le perrie desde morrito
Y claro, todos en su rancho son gallos
Pero gallo que va y se les para en su tierra
Y aparte les canta resulta más gallo
Calma guacamayo, yo no te voy a matar
¿Quién mantiene a la familia si me mandan a encerrar?
Pero atente bocón, todos conocemos gente
A ti conocemos y tú no eres delincuente
¿Siente armar?, 'tonces véngame a buscar
Porque yo no tengo tiempo del ""te tiro pa' sonar""

Y yo ando na' más que en la calle quiero verte

Me declararon la guerra tirándome una canción
Todo por la negación, no grabar una canción
Luego fuimos pa' la calle y abortaron la misión
¿Si tu ídolo no te pela te le viras a traición?
Me sacan de quicio y yo no acepto las disculpas
A ti te acabo el vicio, no me eche' a mí la culpa
Mantenga a la mujer para que no le ponga el cuerno
Suelta un poco el foco y metale al cuaderno
Luego vas y me demandas, loca por lo que te toca
Más dinero, más problemas, yo ya me llene de broncas
Se ponen a tirar, pues les llegó la decadencia
Saco mi CD y luego les mando a la delincuencia
Después por consecuencia, firmo con Universal
Compro mi Catedral y voy y pago mi sentencia

Pero todos somos malos, 'che viejillo cagapalos

If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites

[Verse 1]
When you make love, do you look in your mirror?
Who do you think of? Does he look like me?
Do you tell lies and say that it's forever?
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Okay
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing, or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No

[Chorus]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

[Verse 2]
When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about
Ooh, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh

[Chorus]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

[Instrumental Break]
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No!

[Chorus]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees

It's what I need

If you've got love in your sights
Watch out

Make amends

Something is tempting the father

But, now that I am older, I’ll admit that I am over all the stress and shit that comes from holding life up on your shoulders

With old tunes jammin on my Walkman, and some Sour Patch Kids and a Coke can
I don’t wanna think about anything at all, I just wanna run around doin what I want
With a pretty ass girl and a slow jam, and some Sour Patch Kids and a Coke can"

[Verso 1]
Vivo fingiendo un sueño que no se cuenta
Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote
Pero el amor se escapa, aunque yo te mienta
Yo estaba buscándote, sola aquí esperándote

[Pre-coro]
Y tú, mirándome sin hablar
Y yo, hablándote sin mirar
Y tú, no sé lo que estás sintiendo
Pero yo me estoy muriendo
No aguanto más

[Coro]
Bailar contigo, y perdernos esta noche
Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más
Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores
Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar

[Post-coro]
(Uououououo)
Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote
(Uououououo)
Vivo imaginándote

[Verso 2]
El mar de tu piel, quiero navegar
Perderme en las olas contigo
Bailando en las olas contigo

Un barco de papel, te quiero regalar
Para que vengas conmigo
Bailando en las olas conmigo

[Pre-coro]
Y tú, mirándome sin hablar
Y yo, hablándote sin mirar
Y tú, ya sé lo que estás sintiendo
Ya sabes que estoy muriendo
No aguanto más

[Coro]
Bailar contigo, y perdernos esta noche
Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más
Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores
Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar

[Post-coro]

Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote
(Uououououo)
Vivo imaginándote

[Puente]
Cuando bailas brillan las estrellas
Todas se derriten sobre el mar
Espuma sobre el mar

Sigo caminando tras tus huellas
Y aunque se derriten en el mar
Yo te voy a encontrar

[Coro]
Bailar contigo, y perdernos ésta noche
Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más
Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores
Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar

Yeah, it's 50
One shot, one kill, what's the deal
Yeah, what's the deal

[Chorus]
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up, that's when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothin' changed, niggas doin' the same ol' shit
Them new hollow tips in them same ol' clips
In the projects, niggas fuck with the same ol' chicks
And somehow, they still think they game's so sick
Now from the rip, niggas know I'm 'bout my grip
I don't trick, man I barely even feed a bitch
She say I'm stingy, I say, ""I don't need you bitch""
Go 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit!
Tell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'ma get her
She know I'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga?
She just mad, cause a nigga pockets on swole
When she ask to borrow some, I say, ""Hell naw!""
I was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit
To keep yo' mind on yo' money and don't trust no bitch
Ke Ke hit high notes, when them pigs came
But her ass kinda fat, so niggas treat her the same
This is real

[Chorus]
Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up, that's when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Blood stains on my stoop, when Akbar got shot
When homicide outside, nigga I'm not
This the third time them niggas done circled the block
It's money down now, yeah, but damn it's hot
They'll love to catch a nigga, on a direct sale
They say, ""tell us who caught the body, or you goin' to jail""
Look, if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge
And say what's happenin' to the captain
And what's up to the sarge
Fuck bein' in a cage man, that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb
I know a spot full of niggas tryin' to bet a few bucks
Hopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck
Two Ace to the deuce, and stumbled off mad
Lost his re-up money man, that's all he had
Magazine from the store, so he can look at the cars
And do pull ups in the park, on the monkey bars
Mad as fuck

[Chorus]

Get caught in lead showers just because

Yo reconozco a las que son como tú
Quieren comerse la miel, pero no son winnie pooh
Te entre la multitud y llamó tu actitud
De esos que están detrás de ti se han visto con lentitud
Entonces dime eres de las que quiere fiesta o cine
Vamos a portarnos mal o quieres que me persigne
Dime si es amor o quieres que te patrocine
Ponte en cuatro a lo que vine, rompamos un record guiness
La última vez en el hotel se armó un escándalo
Todo se puso mejor cuando la luz se apagó
Fumamos tanto de la buena que hasta se acabó
Pareciera que me enamoré aquel sábado

Soy el juego del burro, anda ven ponme la cola
Tienes mala fama y te pareces a Danna Paola
Estas bien ri—sueña mamacita, eres mi dueña
Dices que conmigo sueñas, al fuego le echaste leña
Y suéltate la greña como Gloria Trevi
Desde que te vi supe que se íbamos a pasarla heavy
Las mujeres me acosan, cabrón me siento William Levy
¿Quien te dijo que traigo dinero? Anda súbete al Chevy (Jaja)
Unos me dicen que te vieron por ahí hace tiempo
Pero no estoy para juzgarte, yo me sé ese cuento
Siguete moviendo que me tienes contento

Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way
I fight you like a matador, fresh out the catalog
One fall we all fall, crew like dominoes
Paper chase, vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke
Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold
We are not alone, bo-boy, better check your tone
You gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers
Yeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury
You lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me
Preferably one of the best

Be loyal, real, and respect, stay ahead of the rest

We got no time to waste
And no way these niggas stoppin' me, oh no
Flyin' from a mile away
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me
Hey look and I can do this with my eyes closed
Blindfold two times over
Ride solo, I got women and got soldiers
I ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over
Talkin' on Melatonin, get it and fight coma
What's a flea to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided
That's cold-blooded
And I've been this dope for like four summers
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake
I know this shit that bone you pick
Might leave you niggas fillets

[Verse 3: YG]
It's YG 4hunnid!
Is you ridin'?
Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence
If Jimmy got caught up, but you was right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet?
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate (That I hate)
You got that fake-friend syndrome
And there's no cure so your symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up (Hold up), each one teach one
Motivate each one to be something
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this, this, and that if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make payday come quicker
For me and my day one hittas

I don't have my license yet
But I think it might be fun to drive with you
You live far and I don't have a car
But I think it might be fun and the sky looks so blue
We'd fill up with gas and we'd move pretty fast
Is that something you'd like to do?
It's crazy, I know, but I wanna go
And I was hoping that you would too

[Chorus]
'Cause when the moon comes up at night
I'm just thinking of you
And when the stars shine this damn bright
All I think of is you
And I think it's starting to rain
And you're all that goes on in my brain
So, maybe it'd be nice to get away

[Verse 2]
Petals are floating and I think I'm choking on air
Raindrops get bigger and I'll start to shiver
But darling, you're still there

[Chorus]
'Cause when the moon comes up at night
All I think about is you
And when the stars shine this damn bright
All I think about is you
And I think that it's starting to pour
But you're all that I wanted and more
So maybe
Just maybe
We could open the door"

Talk to me, man… (Ugh-ugh)
It's your boy, Young Hov
And if you turn the motherfucking noise up
We can get right into the proceedings this evening
The headphones are distortin', bring it down a lil' bit
Okay
Now, we working with it (Ugh, ugh)
The boy Face up in Baseline, baby (Facemob!)
Welcome to New York City (Ugh, ugh, ugh)
It's your boy Young Hov' (Chyeah, chyeah)
Kanye West on the track (Woo!)
Chi-Town, what’s going on now? (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Can I talk to y'all for a minute?
Let me talk to y'all for a minute
Just gimme a minute of your time, baby
I don't want much (Woo!)
Let me talk to these motherfuckers
Ugh!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Guess who's bizzack?
You still smelling crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them roads; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do none wit it, straight from the oven wit it
Came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling ""guts"" every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Facemob, every time we face off
Face it, y'all—y'all niggas playin' basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall (Woo!)
Homie, I'm in the drop with the A/C off
That's why the streets embrace me, dog, I'm so cool!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's bizzack? Back on the block with them O's
Facemob, Mack Mittens and Hov
Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four
'Cause this street shit is all I know

[Verse 2: Scarface]
From the womb to the tomb, a hot pot, a jar and a spoon
Tryna make me forty thousand and move
Motels, star-studded, rockstars and goons
Plainclothes wanna run in my room (Woooo)
But nigga, guess who's bizzack? It's your boy, Facemob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake, dog
Give niggas a break? Nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? (No!)
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the '88
Don't got no wholesale, 'cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones, and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fo'-shizzle, my nizzle
Your block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make for sure I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war, and you ain't making a dime, haha!
'Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta get him some shoes

[Bridge: Scarface]
It's a new game brewing, let me give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, ha
It's a new game goin', lemme give you the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, haha! (Whoa)

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Guess who bizzack? The boy, B-Mizzack (Yeah)
AKA Mr. Crack-A-Brick (Straight)
Turn a whole one from a half a brick
Look, I mastered this, you can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make you swell up if you gasket-clipped
You can make your chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watching traffic switch
Young'un, never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz (Huh)
And keep your whole hood on flip (Ugh)
Like old box-spring, pissy mattress shit
No, won't box a thing, strictly blasting shit
I hug the block like quarter-water (Ugh)
Shit, I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
'Til, like, deuce in the morning
With the old heads (Ugh), slangin' loose quarters (Quarters)
This Philly cat back at it (At it)
Still fucking with them crack addicts, still busting with that black-matic

Hab' die Zukunft geseh'n (Zukunft geseh'n)
Komme nicht klar, blond oder schwarz
Nur ein Luxusproblem
Noch vor kurzem war ich immer pleite
Wollte Bitches, aber kriegte keine
Mittlerweile sind die Chicks am streiten
Wer kriegt mich alleine und ich nehm' sie beide
Suite im Hyatt für'n wilden Dreier
Bis zum Höhepunkt, als wär's der Himalaya
Danach zieh' ich eine zwischen ihren Beinen (Jaa)
Zieh' dann Leine und muss wieder weiter

С голыми руками или в руках АК
Тебя это не коснулось? Так это пока
Ладно, мне пора, братка, пока
Мама, I'm a криминал
Это то, чем живёт детвора в забытых богом дворах
Хули там: якудзы, триады, коза ностры
В России рано повзрослели дети девяностых (Criminal)
Мама, I'm a криминал
Когда те, кто у руля, топят нас как котят
Признавать их власть — как принимать яд
Чем заодно с ЧК, лучше вообще никак
Мама, I'm a криминал
Судьба наносит на гранит имена
Ведь каждого в финале ждёт чёрный пенал
Да, ставка слишком высока
Мама, I'm a криминал
Когда такая делюга, по-другому никак
Каждый сам ищет выход из тупика
У каждого свой УК

Мама, I'm a криминал
Стелет фирменно — сто процентов федерал
Мол, такая делюга: прикуп на дербан
А в прикупе ему звезда, а нам тюрьма
Мама, I'm a криминал
Набрал в рот воды, а так грамотно втирал
Набирал баллы, нихуёво блатовал
А как припекло, щеманулся к ментам
Мама, I'm a криминал
Не знаю, как будет там, но пока не упал
Обойдусь без вискаря и кубинских сигар

Zrobię ci shame i shiner

Chcą mnie podglądać, fajnie

Noszę tablety w sakwie
Rozrzucam nim grać zacznę
One są takie fajne

Humanity, auf wiedersehen
It's time to say goodbye, the party's over
As the laughter dies, an angel cries
Humanity, it's au revoir to your insanity
You sold your soul to feed your vanity
Your fantasies and lies

You're a drop in the rain
Just a number, not a name
And you don't see it
You don't believe it

You're a needle in the hay

And now you got to deal with it

Be on your way, adios amigo
There's a price to pay
For all the egotistic games you played

The water's gonna rise and pull you under
In your eyes, I'm staring at the end of time
Nothing can change us
No one can save us from ourselves

Jij bent VIP, maar huur is laag
Gang, dus heel de buurt is daar
Schaats op linker, huur geen kab
Altijd drip, dure smaak
Dr-dr-draag Amiri van m'n top tot m'n teen
Flex is anders, krijg betaald om te feesten
100 bitches en we zijn met z'n twee
Hele avond op dezelfde location
Ik kom binnen met 10 kop staff
Altijd lit, dus ik zie geen rij
Al die kippen zijn hier op mij
En ik weet niet eens wie ze zijn (prr)

Illie slaat beats, net bokser (hey!)
En hij maakt het goed net dokterrr

Estaba sola, cantando por mi cuenta

Y estoy bailando al ritmo de tu corazón
Y cuando te vas, me siento incompleta

[Verso 2]
Lo siento si es demasiado
Todos los días que estás aquí, estoy sanando
Y me estaba quedando sin suerte
Nunca pensé que encontraría este sentimiento
Porque he estado escuchando sinfonías
Antes de todo lo que escuché fue silencio
Una rapsodia para ti y para mí (Una rapsodia para ti y para mí)
Y cada melodía es atemporal

[Pre-Coro]
Y ahora tu canción está en repetición
Y estoy bailando al ritmo de tu corazón
Y cuando te vas, me siento incompleta
Entonces, si quieres la verdad

Heart of an altar boy molested in confession
Who plotted for 20 years then slit the throat of a reverend
And half of this thought is young vandal the system
Contraption of credo drift sick shit and spit at your heaven
I'm grabbin' my dick again
Foot on the wall
Pose down
I'm drinkin' that piss again
Back at the train, hometown
Starscream the system
Ninja star the cassette deck
Lazerface is back in effect!
Focus like a worker ant live
Get with hive mind fly shit
Shut your little mind crime hybrid
Eyelids pinned back flat
We had a focus group of lab rats clappin'
At last you got dap
Automaton bells rock well from death valley
Shit, we all mingle in ditch
Mass grave for the kids
Clash with the combat rap set
A weathermen funk breath
The last rebels left?
Slide off or get the digipack slashed in your neck
You're figitin' with 28 day simian
Yeah, dog
Him again
The bad touch destruct militant
Drum percussion lust diligent
The surface that gave birth to the style is NY
The jihad recipient sky is too fly
The roof of the witnessing spot was BK
A cloud of asbestos - I guess it's d-day
Now you want me to move and do how you say
Or look into my brain through this glass toupee
Fuck this, how 'bout I just smack you bitch?
Save that 4th reich boogie for them plastic twits
Or the old women of fate stichin' the casket nits
I'll be drunk on the back of the train takin' a piss
Bumpin' BDP through a raheem kit
With a double d duracel destiny megamix like

Get on some butterfly to the fire shit
Everything must go
I wanna sell you the dream

Excuse me, little child
Why the devious smile?
Well, I've become what I've forsaken and the irony's wild
Are you in charge of this outfit?
Nah, not me, cousin
I wrestle distinction from the chompers of a buzzard
Is my mommy in heaven?
Well, she's definitely not here
Now run away and go play with this hatchet and flaming spear
I'm tryna mix up this molotov then peel the fuck off
I've got a windmill to tackle, son
Polish my gun off
My hot pink milimeter space heater
Duck down
Pulled out from the crevice of a triple fat duck down
Horse hooves and meat I'm glued to the beat - grindin'
Stolen hovercraft draggin' a bass stab behind it
Every little phrase is designed for y'all to rewind it
Every brittle phase has an expiration assignment
Eyes wide
The bad man walks alive with five dimes of sticky the bush and no 9
Who was trained by Ed Koch to hop a turnstyle
See cop smile
Peep cops gun
Now see little juvenile me in reeboks run
Through the projected transformation of the catacombs, son
Makin' it home's so fun
If you're alone, don't sweat
Cause you're alone with the best
The underrated phrase mason who's leakin' pain to cassette
If you hate lies, don't fret
Cause I can't lie about this
At least I'm honest when I tell you that my mind's full of shit
And sick of skippin' on electrified hop scotch grid
We're double dutchin' to percussion with this barbed wire rope choker
The most floatinist spoke dope spit
Get lit
You're with an ambulance chaser, I strive design sick

A fucked up childhood is why the way I am
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn
Hmm, somebody help me
But nah, they don't hear me though
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto
Ain't no escapin', 'cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin', and on top of that got Moms sprung
Scheamin' off the top, Pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga
Now my pops is gone and that ain't no good
Got to follow in the footsteps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Niggas puttin' brew in my fuckin' baby bottle
Damn! And through all the motherfuckin' pain
They done drove my moms insane
So, I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I grow up to be a streiht up menace, gyeah

Now I'm of age, and livin' in the projects
Gettin' paid off the clucks and the county checks

That the motherfuckin' hood would take me under
Gyeah, I'm kickin' it with the homies and they got the straps
Off to the corner store, owned by the fuckin' (Japs)
See a bitch in the right lane, so I comes with the mack
Astro Van pulls a motherfuckin' jack from the back
Now he's got the strap to my homie's head
Sayin': ""Play that shit cool, and don't be a fool!""
He shot my nigga in the fuckin' head
I caught one in the shoulder, if I didn't run I was dead
Now I'm layin' in the hospital bed
Thinkin' about them punk motherfuckers
And my eyes is bloodshot red
Gyeah, motherfuckers, I ain't finished
Be on the look-out for the streiht up menace, gyeah

I'm in too deep
I done killed a motherfucker and I just can't sleep
One-Time's tryin' to do a smooth creep
And on top of that
Niggas after me for fuckin' one of they hood rats
I ain't got time for the fuckin' bitch's story
Niggas want me gotta come to my territory
And ain't no 'you can get the fist'
Niggas come, and they get done on they own risk
What is it all about?
Should I leave or should I stay, 'cause I don't wanna punk out
Oh what should I do?
The homies say: ""The hood's where it's good
Homeboy, I thought you knew.""
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react, caught two in the chest
Now look who's down, I guess I'm finished
I go out like a streiht up menace, gyeah

Uhh, come on, y'all
Streiht up menace

And on and on
I guess we outta here

[Zwrotka 1]
Okej, robię, robię się dorosły, bo chyba muszę płacić za me auta
Te diamenty na szyi, to wszystko to nie bogactwa
Zrobiłem dużo więcej i jest dumna moja matka
Pierdolone trofea zwisają mi tak jak jajca
I robię co chcę, uwierz, będę palił dużo
Mam w głowie dużo snów, ciągle chcę być kurwa chmurą
I latać po tym niebie i nie czuć wcale ciała
Pierdolone używki, ty wiesz jak to działa
Kosa z wieloma ludźmi, każdy idzie w swoją stronę
Mam dużo do stracenia, myślę żeby mieć ochronę
(Wiesz o co chodzi)
Bo mogę stracić koronę (o tak)
Próbuje zachować głowę

[Refren]
Ona nie wie, że ma do czynienia z bestią
I jeśli będzie miała dalej, diabeł to jej dziecko
Kto zapłaci jak za studia, jak za ciuchy
Wiesz o co chodzi, dwa tysiące za buty
Chodzę tak jakbym miał skrzydła na sobie
Rozumiem wasz ból, bo też byłem na dole
I to co zrozumiałem, trzeba pracować ciągle
Bo sukces w żaden sposób nigdy nie istniał w szkole

Z takimi jak my to można tylko świat zdobywać

Dużo skuna, wiesz o co chodzi
Duże pieniądze, wiesz o co chodzi

Ona nie wie, że ma do czynienia z bestią

Bo sukces w żaden sposób nigdy nie istniał w szkole

A que hoy estés conmigo y mañana con tu dueña
Si me vuelve a pasar, me muero

Has that kind of whip appeal on me, yeah

Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me

Look-a here, baby

[Verse 2]
When we go to work
How the day seems so long
The only thing I think about
Can't wait 'til we get home
'Cause we got a way of talking
And it's better than words
It's the strangest kind of relationship
Oh, but with us it always works

[Pre-Chorus]
And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me, oh

Whatever you want

You've got that whip appeal

So whip it on me

(This is the remix)
Mami, ¿qué fue?
Voy de camino a tu habitación
Me dejaste con má' ganas que ayer
Mamacita, esta e’ la segunda versión

[Pre-Coro: Rauw Alejandro]
Son las 2 a.m. y ya estoy saliendo
De camino me queda tu casa (Queda tu casa)
La luna está perfecta pa' hacerlo
Espero que contestes mi llamada (Mi llamada)

[Coro: Rauw Alejandro & Lyanno]
Mala mía, sé que es tarde
Es que esta bellaquera es solo contigo (Contigo)
Sin que se enteren tus padres (Oh, yeah)
Yo te busco, escápate conmigo
Que antes que se levanten, volvemos (¡Oh!)
Antes que se levanten, volvemos (Uh-uh-uh-uh)
Antes que se levanten, volvemos
Yo te busco, escápate conmigo

[Verso 1: Lunay]
Lu-Lu-Lunay
Baby, más que tuya tú ere' mía (Mía)
Te recuerdo que no era yo, era’ tú la que quería'
Mira ahora adónde estás metía'
Solo somo' tú y yo, y por cómo grita' parece que e' una orgía
Si te hago venir con facilida', de aquí no te va' a ir
Pichea la universida’, ya son má’ de las 12
Ya tú ni las llamadas las responde'
Porque te tengo en las pose’ y nadie se imagina en dónde

[Verso 2: Rauw Alejandro]
(Ra-Rauw)
El asiento de atrás todavía huele a ti (Yeh)
¿Te acuerda' de aquella vez? (Yah) Que las pierna' te llevé (Wuh)
A tu cuello, pa' que llegue má’ adentro 'e ti (Yuh)
Sabe' que no me quité, el partido lo gané, ey (Yah)
De camino en la Mercede' (Ey)
Imagina que estamo' en lo' eighties (Oh-yeah)
Pichamo' la movie del drive-in
Y hacemo' un par de babie' (Ey)
Veo que dejaste tu blusa
No paro de recordarte (Ey)
Siempre buscando una excusa
Pa' a tu casa desviarme, jeje (Eh-eh, yeah)

[Estribillo: Rauw Alejandro, Alex Rose & Lunay]
Mala mía, sé que es tarde
Es que esta bellaquera, es solo contigo (Contigo)
Sin que se enteren tus padres (Oh, yeah)

Que antes que se levanten, volvemos (Oh-yeah)
Antes que se levanten, volvemos
Antes que se levanten, volvemos (Oh-yeah)
Yo te busco, escápate conmigo

[Verso 3: Lyanno, Rauw Alejandro & Lyanno]
Ly-Ly-Ly
Dile que eres mía desde la superior (Yeh-yeh)
Tú en mis fantasía' y yo en tu interior (Uh)
Pastilla' y alcohol, baby, ponte el babydoll
Que hoy, mi lobo en tu media luna mata hasta que salga el sol, yeh
¿Qué le pasa a tu mamá? Dile que ya tú fuma' y mama'
Que desde los dieciséis, jugábamo' de mano en tu cama
Yo sé que tengo mala fama, pero cuadra con tu hermana
Que deje abierta la ventana pa' que el rey se coma a su dama

[Verso 4: Alex Rose]
Yeah
Hello, bebé, baja que ya llegué
No quería ser infiel y contigo se la' pegué
Es que esta bellaquera es solo contigo
Si quiere' lo hacemo' suave pa' no hacer ruido
Mala mía, bebé, es que me enamoré
De ese totito y volví a echártela dentro otra ve'
Creo que vo'a dejarla pa' irme contigo
Prendemo' de camino, escápate conmigo

[Verso 5: Lenny Tavárez]
(Lenny Tavárez)
Antes de las cinco, estás de vuelta (Sí, ajá)
Pero no va' a querer que te devuelva (Nah)
No te duermas, que ahí viene el rescate (Seesh, ajá)
Antes de que solita te maltrate'
Voy de camino con phillie prendío' (Shh-ah)
De fondo tengo ""Te Boté"", pero escápate conmigo (Yah-yah)
No sé si tan bellaca te han tenido
Ponte pa' la venganza (Ajá), yo me vengo contigo (Yeh)

Y antes que se levanten, nos vemo'
Antes que se levanten, volvemo'
Yo te busco, escápate conmigo

[Verso 6: Cazzu]
Vuelve corriendo a mi cama, baby, dormimo' calentito'
Ya no me aguanto las gana' de besar tu cara de caramelito
Rápido te necesito pa' comerte completito
Sin prisa, voy despacito, oh-yeh, oh-yeh
Mala mía, mala mía, sé que ya es de madruga'
Pero vamo' a enrolar, hoy
Que me pongo loca si es que no contesta mis llama'
¿La bebé dónde está? Oh

[Puente: Cazzu & Eladio Carrión]
Y ante' que se levanten, nos vemo'
Y sin que se enteren, nos comemo'
Mejor no digas na' y nos vencemo'
(Eladio Carrión, ¡sendo cabrón!)
Mala mía, bebé

[Verso 7: Eladio Carrión]
Cógelo baby, que estoy llamando (Prr, prr)
Compré tres botella', mami, y ya van do' (Skrr, skrr)
Tengo un krippy que te patea como taekwondo (Auh-auh)
Pero sé que hay otro que te está enamorando (Prr, prr)
También sé que esa mente te está lavando (Damn!)
Pero solamente dime, mami, dónde y cuándo (¡Cuándo!)
Si total siempre te termina' escapando (Uh), ey
Y encima de mi cama brincando, ey-ey (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Gracia' a ti, bebé, no creo ya en el amor (-mor)
Pero, por favor, llámame cuando me necesite' (Oh-yeh)
Nunca hace falta que yo la lubrique (Oh-oh)
Al novio, que se quite y que no se pique (Yeh-eh)
Que tengo una forty para que se ubique (Oh-oh)
Baby, dile que mejor que no compite, ey

[Estribillo: Rauw Alejandro]
Mala mía, sé que es tarde
Es que esta bellaquera es solo contigo (Contigo)
Sin que se enteren tus padres (Oh, yeah)
Yo te busco, escápate conmigo

They call the emerald land
And I remember my home town

Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear them sing again

We're going back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're going back, back to the wild frontier

I remember my city streets
Before the soldiers came
Now armoured cars and barricades
Remind us of our shame

We are riding in a sea of blood
The victims you have seen
Nevermore to sing again
The forty shades of green

We're going back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling

Those are the days I will remember
Those are the days I most recall
We count the cost of those we've lost
And pray it's not in vain
The bitter tears of all those years
I hope we live to see those days again

Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear us sing again
The forty shades of green

And I remember a friend of mine
So sad now that he's gone
They tell me I'll forget as time goes on

We're going back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're going back, back to the wild frontier"

Mesa rap, bitch
Rodri, Monti, ah
Dame la lu', dame la lu', ah
Dice

[Verso 1]
En mi combo no entran las rata'
Entro pa' la disco coronando plata
Cien paca' en el cajón de mi casa
Mujeres que me abrazan
No le tiro al Whatsapp por si amenaza
Que ando con los de raza
Mi cara está en la grasa
Dando nota que la deja en el sky, como una .45
Puesto pa'l calor, me siento en Dubai
Pablo hace una llamada inesperada, ticket' verde' como rana' bajan pa' mis pana'
¿Qué será mañana si no estoy en vida sana? Se lo prometí a mi mamá
La muerte me llama y el diablo me ama
Linda la película, pero vivo la trama
Y si la fama me gana, se me cerró la telón mañana
Y no la cuento, perro, yo metí mano y no me arrepiento
No nací con plata, si no tengo, siempre me la invento
No soy abierto pero a vece' intento
Y lo lamento si les molestó, cuento lo que siento

[Estribillo]
Viviendo rápido, pisando sin pedir perdón
Salgo a buscar lo mío y sigo hasta que salga el sol
Mi gente fuerte, tiene lealtad y corazón
Nunca me arrepiento, a mí solo me juzga Dios
Viviendo rápido, pisando sin pedir perdón
Salgo a buscar lo mío y sigo hasta que salga el sol
Mi gente fuerte, tiene lealtad y corazón
Nunca me arrepiento, a mí solo me juzga Dios

[Verso 2]
Esto es el infierno, pero yo estoy en el baile
Un ángel me gritó, ""Cuida'o, la movie está que arde"" (Arde)
Me porto muy formal, mi gente nunca llega tarde (Tarde)
Si se porta muy mal conmigo le apagamo' el trailer (Ah, ah)
Otra noche más que me salí a buscar mi pa'
Mis tigre' van y se montan, si asoman la cabeza se las volan
Prendo un fino color caimán que lo bajan de Michoacán
Mis mujere' se lo arman y lo que ven se lo guardan
Así que sigo en la gira, buscando todo pa' un día que no me falte nada y darle todo a la madre mía
Mientra' eso' bobo' me miran, sigo pendiente a la mía
Si un día yo valgo mis compañero' no se me olvidan
No hay aspirina que sirva y me saque el dolor que traigo
Cambié canica por los trago', de nuevo no me caigo
Rodri arráncate el mecho, dale que salimo' volando
Y ahora estamo' joseando en escenario' con mi bando

[Estribillo]
Viviendo rápido, pisando sin pedir perdón
Salgo a buscar lo mío y sigo hasta que salga el sol
Mi gente fuerte, tiene lealtad y corazón
Nunca me arrepiento, a mí solo me juzga Dios
Viviendo rápido, pisando sin pedir perdón
Salgo a buscar lo mío y sigo hasta que salga el sol
Mi gente fuerte, tiene lealtad y corazón
Nunca me arrepiento, a mí solo me juzga Dios
Viviendo rápido, pisando sin pedir perdón
Salgo a buscar lo mío y sigo hasta que salga el sol

[Verso 1]
Me reflejo en la luz
De tus ojos que brillan
Por esa valentía
Que no viene en la voz

[Pre Coro 1]
Cuando vamos las dos
Son tus pasos la vía
La bajada nos guía
En directo al amor...

[Coro]
Y al pasar la intensidad
Que me llevo a cambiar
Mi animal siempre vas
Perpendicular
Voy pasando el deseo
Que me hace brillar
Un momento que en el tiempo
Se mantendrá

[Verso 2]
Voy directo a la luz
De todas las estrellas
Mucho miedo me entrega
Ni tu mano me das

[Pre Coro 2]
Cuando miro mi error
Se me nubla la vista
Finalizo la lista
Cuando sola se esta

[Coro]
Y al pasar la intensidad
Que me llevo a cambiar
Mi animal siempre vas
Perpendicular
Voy pasando el deseo
Que me hace brillar
Sentimiento que en el tiempo
Se mantendrá

[Post Coro]
Que me hace llorar

[Puente]
Voy a aprender
Que al perder de mi vida
El poder otro lado será ver
Mucho más velocidad
Encantar que la edad
Muchas veces nos traiciona
Y no hay nada mas
En mi

De volta em casa, fumando um legalizado (Legalizado)
Eu tenho mais hits do que os Beatles (Beatles)
Carro estrangeiro correndo no diesel, mano
Brincando com meu nome, essa merda é letal, mano (Quem você disse que era?)
Don Corleone
Confie em mim, no topo não é solitário (Armado)

Não diga que você tá abatido, você tem que me mostrar (O que você tem que fazer?)
Traga o pente de volta vazio (Tá vazio)
Você pediu pra ver o chefe, então eles me mandaram, mano (Me mandaram, mano)
Eu acabei de terminar com ela por 10 peças, mano (10 peças, mano)
Isso não é nada, eu só tô sendo amigável, mano

[Refrão: Drake]
São apenas 10 peças pra ela
Apenas pra gastar no shopping, não significa que estamos envolvidos
Eu só... o que? Eu só... uh, coloquei um Richard no cartão
Eu não cresci jogando bola, mas eu vou te mostrar como você tem que fazer nessa porra
Se você realmente quer gastar até falir
Quando você tá com as costas contra a parede
E um monte de manos precisam que você vá embora
Ainda chego forte neles de qualquer maneira
Vi você ontem à noite, mas fiz isso um dia amplo

[Pós-Refrão: Drake]
Yeah, muitos Murakami no corredor (O quê?)
Tenho uma arma e eu guardo na casa do meu parceiro
Garota, eu deixei seu amor no Magic, agora tá tudo embaçado
Ainda chego forte em você de qualquer maneira

Eu poderia colocar 80 mil nas minhas Amiris (80 mil)
Eu e o Drizzy lado a lado, tá ficando assustador (Lado a lado)
Se você foder com meus camaradas, apenas não chegue perto de mim (Sai do meu caminho)
Coloco uma grana pela sua cabeça igual o Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille custando uma Lambo (Isso é uma Lambo)
Conhecido por manter as vadias mais gostosas na comanda (Saudação)
Toda vez que tô no tráfico, eu me movo igual o Rambo (Pente alongado)
Não tem um bairro na Filadélfia que eu não possa ir (Isso é um Fendi)
De verdade
Ela disse: ""Oh, você é rico mesmo?"" (""Você é rico mesmo"")
Vadia, eu sou formado, me chame de ""Peixe Grande"" (Marlin)
Eu tenho a Lori Harvey na minha lista de desejos (Essa é a Lori)
Essa é a única coisa que eu quero pro Natal (História verdadeira, uh)
Fiz meu caminho até aqui, yeah, sei que são fatos (Fatos)
Você não tá vivendo essa merda que você diz, sim, a gente sabe que é mentira (Isso é mentira)
Você não precisa me perguntar quando me vê, sabe que eu tô armado (Brrt)

[Kayıt Bilgisi]

[Verse 1: Coolio]
Karanlık ölüm vadisinde yürürken
Hayatımı gözden geçiriyorum ve geriye bir şey kalmadığını farkediyorum
Çünkü o kadar uzun zamandır ateşleyip gülüyordum ki
Annem bile aklımı yitirdiğimi düşünüyor
Ama asla bunu hakeden birini engellemedim
Bana serseri gibi davranıldığını duymamışsındır
Dikkat etsen iyi olur nasıl konuştuğuna,nereye gittiğine
Yoksa sen ve kankaların belkide bir tebeşirle çizilirsiniz
Gerçekten yolculuktan nefret ederim , ama olayı yoluna sokmak lazım
Ölürken onlar, kendimi tabancanın dumanında görebiliyorum
Aptal, Ben o küçüklerin olmak istediği tarzda bir gangstayım
Gece dizlerimin üstünde, sokak lambasına dualar ediyorum

[Hook 1: LV]
Hayatımızın çoğunu boşa harcıyoruz
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak
Harcadılar bütün hayatlarını
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak
Harcıyoruz boşa kendi hayatımızı
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak
Harcıyoruz boşa kendi hayatımızı
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Şu duruma bak benimle yüzleştiler
Normal bir hayat yaşayamam,sokak tarafından büyütüldüm
Öyleyse mahallemdeki adamlarla takılmalıyım
Çok fazla televizyon izlemek beni hayallere daldırıyor
Aklında sürekli para olan parayla eğitilmiş bir aptalım
Elimde uzi ve gözlerimde ışıltı
Ben bir crip gangsterim, kavgalar düzenleyen
Ve arkadaşlarım öldü,öyleyse benim tepemin tasını artırma
Aptal, ölüm bir kalp atışından uzakta değildir
Yap veya öl tarzında bir hayat yaşıyorum, ne diyebilirim ki?
Şu an 23 yaşındayım, ama 24 yaşımı görebilicek miyim?
Böyle giderse bilemiyorum

[Hook 2: LV]
Söyle bana neden görmek için bu kadar körüz?
Acı çekenler sen ve ben değil miyiz?

[Hook 1: LV]
Hayatımızın çoğunu boşa harcıyoruz
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak
Harcadılar bütün hayatlarını
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak
Harcıyoruz boşa kendi hayatımızı
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak
Harcıyoruz boşa kendi hayatımızı
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Güç ve para,para ve güç
Dakikalar dakikaları,saatleri saatleri kovalıyor
Herkes koşturuyor, ama nedeninden bir haberler
Mutfakta bir şeyler pişiyor, ama ne olduğunu bilmiyorum
Öğreniceğimi söylediler, ama bana kimse öğretmiyor
Ama anlayamazlarsa, nasıl bana ulaşabilirler?
Sanırım yapamazlar, Sanırım yapamayacaklar
Sanırım bana karşılar işte bu nedenle neden hayatımın şanssız olduğunu biliyorum, aptal!

[Hook 1: LV]
Hayatımızın çoğunu boşa harcıyoruz
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak
Harcadılar bütün hayatlarını
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak
Harcıyoruz boşa kendi hayatımızı
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak
Harcıyoruz boşa kendi hayatımızı
Gangster cennetinde yaşayarak

Söyle bana neden o kadar körüz ki
Acı çekenlerin sen ve ben olduğunu göremiyoruz?
Söyle bana neden o kadar körüz ki

She put my name with yellow hearts

I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)

[Verse 1]
I drive down open roads so slow
Here comes a train, I'll let it go
Ain't got nobody on my phone
Don't like being all alone (Don't like being all alone)
Not good at keeping with the trends (No, no)
Too good at welcoming amends
It's been a while since I've heard her say
That we were more than friends (Oh)
Oh, I, I-I-I, know a lot is going on
But girl, please tell me
And I'll let you be
Are you still with me or not?

She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you, what do they really mean?
Have you only been playing games?

[Verse 2]
I'm by the garden with the carpenter bees
Like I'm Bob Ross-in' with a Harden beard
Taking it all in like I got no issues in my nature
Primroses blooming in the night
Birds wanna take me on a flight
Appreciating my land 'fore it turns into a glacier
Chasers are of no good use
This taste will be long endured
Why'd you have to go so soon?
I thought this was as good as new

[Interlude]
She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you, what do they really mean?
Have you only been playing games?

I don't really remember feeling like this

[Verse 1]
Got this love formin' in my life-for this dame
And indeed took the form of life-and that's a shame
How a man can fall in love with dreams--not afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave
Do your thang MaryJane mess with all my folks-got 'em high
For the days that they were lost and broke-shit got 'em by
Only right we stop and give her props
Plus she from the block of only finer crops
Do your thang MaryJane

Chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
Do your thang MaryJane
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary

[Verse 2]
When the world starts to stress you out-what you do?
Put a cancer stick up in your mouth-or grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains is-they the blame
And the government's been taxin' that -- gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke--kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks- true or not
Other people try to make you bad--but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of need-all I need
Your natural you come from seeds-I decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name
Do your thang MaryJane

Chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
MaryJane do your thang
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary

[Verse 3]
When you sad depressed and feeling strange-who you blame
Need some company to keep you sane-call her name
MaryJane I love you MaryJane-do your thang
You're all I need to get me through this thang-true to game
You ain't never made me smash my thangs-crash the Range
Anything you've always kept me tame-and its plain
For me to see that you my everything-MaryJane
MaryJane helps to ease the brain-when you hang
Through the seasons you ain't never change-stayed the same
Never seen what people seen in speed-you became
Naturally you everything we need-do the thang
Do your thang baby true indeed
Do your thang Mary Jane

[Chorus]
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
Mary Jane do your thang

Uh huh, the Three 6 Mafia, loungin' in the studio
Finna give y'all a little demonstration
Of how we kick it here in the M-Town
Finna drop it somethin' like this

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
See in Memphis, them players be kind of like laid back
In some clean ass rides, blunts in the sack, I'm blowin' a pack
Hittin' the park at 'bout three, sometimes a little later
The last day of the week, and it couldn't get any greater
They leavin' the park, and hittin' the South Park strip, ride
The South Gate skatin' rink later on that night
We in the lot, boomin' our underground rap tapes
Paul and Juicy Part 2, and for another one, they just couldn't wait
We back at the crib, sweatin' in a lil' room
W-30's, SP-12, and MPCs we use
Straight from the 4 track, to a simple cassette
The stu' will press them up
Now it's time to hit the stereos stores and collect
We at the club Friday's and Saturday's special request made
Me and Juicemane hit the tables, Koop and Scarecrow rock the stage
They get so buck that some fools always gotta start a fight
They usually made us close up early that night
In the summer, in the summer

[Chorus: Ann Hines, 8Balll & DJ Paul]
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out (In the summer)
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out (In the summer)
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out (In the summer)
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Drunk off Red Dog as we ball through the mist of fog
Me, Scarecrow, Crunchy, Skinny, Gin, and my roadie Paul
Fly got his mind up in the sky as we chiefin' high
Black Glocks, that's in the ride, fiendin' for a homicide
Some Tanqueray, Grand Marnier, mixed with little Siz
That's how we always did it since I was a troubled kid
But we don't stop 'cause our heart is pumpin' blood like thunder
No man up in the trauma, head is broken in the summer

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Seasons of the summer, the Scarecrow won't stop ceremonies
'Til the sun sets me ease, until the night fall breeze
Rise up to the darkness, listen close to noises in the streets
Grab my Oz. of Indonesia, 6 philly blunt leafs
Throw on me black khaki slacks and me black t-shirt
And my automatic gat, in case I had to dig a plot of dirt
Then hit Paul up on his home, tell him to bring his slow ass on
So we can hit the honey comb before the ganja's gone
The summer

[Chorus: Ann Hines, 8Balll & Lord Infamous]
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out (In the summer)
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out (In the summer)
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out (In the summer)
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
Pass the E&J, Koop
Then let's take a ride and shoot
To the high school, North Side, where the players rule
I'm scopin' all the freaks, with some weave and a sexy switch
""Can I get your number?"" ""I got a man""
Well, I'ma holler, trick
Ballin' down Vollintine, one time on my mind
If they pull me over, I be hopin' they won't find the nines
Made enough from Evergreen to holler at Blac and Cam
Chiefin' on the blunts, in the alley, slangin' boulder yam
Couldn't forget my roadie Big Kurt, Swally and Dion
Project Pat, and the L lavish shootin' teflon
Just a few homies who I grew up in the hood with me
And the ones in Orange Blossom, Hubert University, yeah
It's gettin' late, and now I'm ballin' down Eldridge street
Blowin' my horn, tryin' to get this girl attention in front of me
'Cause everyday I might go tryin' to get a freak number
That's how the Juice is, in the summer

[Chorus: Ann Hines, 8Balll & Juicy J]
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out (In the summer)
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out (In the summer)
With my crew, we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies, gettin' smoked out (In the summer)
With my crew, we just ride

[Outro: DJ Paul]
That's how we do it
So that's how it is
The Three 6 Mafia in the house for the 9-5
Straight from the M-Town
The Juice, DJ Paul, Lord Infamous, the Scarecrow
The Koopsta Knicca, and Crunchy Black
We out"

Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah, why you believin' the propaganda?
Why everybody sound like they wanna be from Atlanta?
Are you the voice or the echo?
Are you the nail or the hammer?
I be talkin' while chewin' my beats, I don't mind my manners
Choruses that fit the opera, that's why I need phantoms
I got my doubt at gun point, that's why I need ransoms
And I be handsome, that's why I got your girl before the money
Honestly, I thought I'd have 30m's before my twenties
But I'm cool with how it's happenin'
Girl in San Fran. who wants to cross routes with me
Like a young Colin Kaepernick
Treat the money like a lateral, I'm passin' it
'Cause my family's number one, never put 'em number two
Tryna buy a house in cash for all the times we had to move
All the times my mom cried 'cause she ain't know what else to do
All the times she lost hope 'cause she ain't know what else to lose
All the times I shoot shots 'cause I don't know what else to shoot, man

Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot

[Verse 2: Russ]
I'ma stay winnin', I don't believe in luck
I believe that life's a buffet, better eat it up
I've seen enough to know that I'm really 'bout to blow
Never felt like an employee, always felt like CEO
Even when I stacked shoes, I was never clocked in
Yeah, I always walked out, but I never walked in
That's a tribute to my head-space
And lately my Devils have been Spanish chicks in red lace
Doing Brujeria on me for ten days
More like ten months, but I got out of it
If I fall in love again, it's probably with a Saudi chick
But I keep my head up high and my middle fingers higher, yo

Text a message, I don't know the number

Steady takin' shots, but never hurtin' numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout outs all my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
Time to go, 
Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowin', chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumpin' out the window how I got 'em open

To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine

Que Syko no coma mierda y con la música se bote
Tú quiere', tu whiskycito con tónica
Y un poco de limón pa' que después te ponga' biónica
Quiere', una pastilla 'e maravilla
Que prendan una varilla pa' coger órbita a la milla'

Medícate, tengo lo que quiere'
Por donde tú lo quiere' y como tú lo quiere'
Relájate, que eso no duele
Cierra los ojos, abre la boca, voy a hacer que vuele'
Descontrólate, dóblate, no te deje'
Jálate el pelo, grita duro pa' que te despegue'
Revélate, la vida es una sola
Y uno se lleva lo que le bailó a la boa

[Verso 1: Syko El Terror]
Dale, vamo' arriba, suelta, ponte experimental
Si la pista esta full, pues trépate al billar
Trépate descalza, no seas comemierda
Olvídese del blower, que la voy a despeinar
Así que suéltese el pelo, baila-baila, tranquila
Pre-Préndete un gare', date un shot de tequila
Que la noche está buena pa' reguindarte de la bocina
No seas manila, dale más duro, que no' fuimo' en primera fila, dime

[Puente 1: Syko El Terror & Don Omar]

Que te lleve a la' nube' en un perreo galáctico
Quiere' un perreo intenso (Ok)

[Verso 2: Kendo Kaponi]
La mano al piso y liso
Te dejamo' al gato tuyo parquia'o en el case, hasta nuevo aviso
La gorra 'e Petit pa' trá', no hay que ser mago pa' leerlo
Donde Kaponi parta, no hay doctor pa' coserlo
Como John Travolta, no me frontee de paca y torta
Que yo sí tengo el guille que nadie lo soporta
Un jefe millonario y un combete de la corta
Mami-mami-mami, no te trinque', lo duro e' el chamber de la corta

[Puente 2: Kendo Kaponi & Don Omar]
Tú quiere' que Kaponi te pegue al muro
Que te lleve pa' lo oscuro, esa quiere con el duro

Fui a la discoteca a ver si me conseguía una fresca
Got myself some rum
Cause where I'm from sometimes you need some
Me tomé mi trago y una princesa pasó por mi lado
La miré con ganas, ja, con esa carita de fama
Ella miró (
Oh sí
)
Ella pasó (
Oh no
)
Ella se volteó con una sonrisa
Tengo que bailar con esa muñequita
El DJ puso ""Brinca"" (Jump!)
Y enseguida quise jalarla pa' la pista
Y cuando llegué, ay
Llegó el tiburón y con él se me fue

Okey, tanto, encontré otra chica que estaba mejor
Bailamos tres merengues de corrido y gozamos
Luego nos sentamos, ordenamos bebidas y conversamos
She looked good, so of course I lied, all my girls from the hood
Ella preguntó si tenía novia y yo dije ""no""
Me quité el anillo, despacito me lo metí en el bolsillo
Vino un descarado y me dijo: ""Jojo, ¿tú no ere' casa'o?""
Me quedé pasmado y enseguida se la llevó de mi lado

Trzeba natychmiast żyć, jest później niż sądzisz
Co ma być to będzie nim Bóg da co daje
Tutaj hedoniści myślą, że mają kupę czasu, tupet mają miękkie faje
Samozwana nadymana młoda banda, szlachta
Nie musi pracować póki płaci matka
Los to bandyta jednoręki bez szczęścia pociągasz
Wajchę i tak nie wyciągniesz pengi
Jak nie wyciągniesz to szykuj etacik, za 2200 netto przy dobrych wiatrach
Starczy na PKS poranny do pracy, petko, nie starczy na własny kwadrat
Melancholia i makabra, melanż, czary mary i abracadabra teraz
Nie zamienisz zmarnowanych szans na dużo lepszy czas mimo że chciałbyś nie raz
A to Polska biel i czerwień masz w dowodzie tu
Kraj co da ci mniej niż byś dał tu psu
Jak nie wyrwiesz sam jej z gardła snów zostaje tylko ból
Idziesz na dno w nurt i w muł, kowadło wiąże sznur tu do stóp
I gardło pełne w pół mętnych wód, przez lata adoracji tępych suk
Drogocenna i rzadka jest prawda, półprawdy kupisz tu za pół darmo
Opchną ci je koledzy od jarania, a gdy wjebią w dół to nazwą to karmą
Ecie pecie, to cię poniesie, terefere elemele taki będzie finał

Was it Texas or was it Canada?

Eight bucks even buys a folding chair
I was downing Seagrams on another flight
And I worked that stage all night long (Worked that stage all night long)

And I was much obliged
The old road sure screwed me good this time
It's hard to see where the vicious circle ends

Did they all just fade away?
Holding you in my arms made me feel so happy
Then you said you had to go
What's wrong?
Baby, I need to know,  oh, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it's a dream (Now it's a dream)
Now I wish you could come back to make come true
(You could come back to make come true)
But you're long gone away, (Come on back, baby)
'Cause baby, I'm missing you
I miss you, yes I do from the bottom of my heart

(I'm talking to you, baby) Hear me when I say
(I miss you) Oh, yes I do

(I miss you) Only to you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought you'd be with me forever
But I guess someone took my place
Took the place of me loving you
And making love to you all through the night
I wish you were still here so I can see your pretty face again
Please come back and rescue me from all this pain and misery
Eh, eh

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it's a dream (Now it's a dream)
And I wish you could come back to make come true
(Come back to make come true)

The way you used to kiss me
Every time I lay at night, all I do is cry
I do love you, baby

There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here and where do we go, and how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together

[Chorus]
Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at them stars and we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

[Verse 2]
And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
Or brings new things, for tomorrow night, you see
That they'll be gone too, too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between
With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango tree now

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

[Post-Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

[Outro]
I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
And I when, and when I wake up
You look so pretty, sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together"

Así e' cómo las herida' sanan
Perreando bien borracho con una fulana
Y un shot y puede que te olvide
Otro show que en el WhatsApp te archivé
Que mucha mierda hablaste, mira cómo terminaste
Porque te lo dije, con tu orgullo dime quién compite
Como la verdad en la cara se dice
No te vo'a dejar de seguir en Twitter
No te pique', que no voy pa' casa
Estoy bien loco y no sé dónde vo'a dormir
Al alcohol le doy gracia' porque lo uso pa' no pensar en ti
Yeah-yeah-eh

[Coro: Brytiago]
Por eso hoy se bebe (Hoy)
No vo'a pensar en ti (Yo)
Tengo a otra que me quiere (Eh)
No se parece a ti (No)
Por eso hoy se bebe

[Verso 2: Nio García]
Seguro que se bebe
Tengo a otra pa' que te releve, yeah
Por mí que el mismo diablo te lleve (Yah)
Y me vas a pagar las que me debe' (Yeah)
Sin ti ya no sufro mal de amore'
Ya no existen más desilusione'
Dicen que te extraño con cojone'
Tranquila, que rumore' son rumore', baby

[Puente: Nio García & Rauw Alejandro]
Yo sé que tú quieres volver (Volver)
Pero no se va a poder (Poder)
Que esta noche voy de rumba, lo nuestro va pa' la tumba
Conmigo tú no vuelve' a joder, yeah, eh, eh
Yo sé que tú quiere' volver (Volver)
Pero no se va a poder (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
En la disco guayando, con los mío' fumando
Contigo tiempo no vo'a perder, woh-oh

Don't care what where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

Maybe, baby, take control of ya just like I told ya
I wanna roll
On the tip that's smooth and
Gonna make ya move and groove and
Leaves ya like ""ooh"" when I touch ya
Give ya so much of

When I rub ya up and down

Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in a style
So what I'm gonna do is kick in something fly and new
A change, this one from the typical
A bit more than regular, I'm not like the others, original

Added up together equals the BBB Posse

Und Papa sagt, er habe Böses in sich (Uh)
Und er gab mir das Gefühl …

And your heart feelin' like it's gon' break
And your earth feels like it's 'bout to shake
And you've taken all that you can take

Realizing you got somewhere to run
Don't worry 'bout what you're going through
Instead of worrying, here's what you can do

And been knocked down as soon as I got on my feet
Lord it was You that helped me understand
And it was You that never let go of my hand
I promise that I'll always give you praise
No matter what this world brings my way

Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

I picked a fight with you
Right out of the blue
I wish we made amends
I didn't mean to lose
All the good times that I had with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
If it doesn't mean too much right now
I know that you've probably forgotten
But these things still weigh me down
Take me back to when
I picked a fight with you, ooh

[Chorus]
I miss the way my mama knew what to do
She said to do right by your neighbour
And they'll do right by you
When we get older we can forget the truth
That if you do right by your neighbour
Then they'll do right by you

[Verse 2]
We play this like a game
Why do we pretend
That we were never friends?
When we both haven't changed
Enough to just forget
The windows we broke with another
The secrets we spoke

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
If it doesn't mean too much right now
I know that you've probably forgotten
But these things still weigh me down

From a hangin' branch in gardens home
Not much is hidden underneath
A rocky heart for breakin' teeth
And apple cores, cyanide seed

All this rotting fruit with you

Swallowed up and angled in
Looking back at sweetness dim
Ripe June had leaf and shady friend
The cool air is gone again

Dark space
I’m slipping into dangerous ways
Looking for a familiar face
Not too far from home
And it's all
It's all, all too much
When you can't see the shiny under the rust
So you hide away, sheltered from the rain

And I've been getting tired of all these patterns
I see it written on the walls
And I've been walking through my own disaster
Thinking it's time to move on

I don't wanna run from a bullet
Gotta leave my candlelight burning
If it goes out, I would lose it
Gotta let my candlelight burn, burn, burn
I feel something pulling
Gotta leave my candlelight burning
If it goes out, I would lose it
Gotta let my candlelight burn, burn, burn, burn

[Verse 2]
Here I lay
In my bed with everything I hate
Dreaming of a distant place
But I'm half way gone
Do you laugh or do you cry?
Do you give up or do you try?
Do you live a lie or live a life?
Who am I, who am I?

Take a shot of whisky and I'm back up
Vodka make these niggas wanna act tough
Run up on my niggas like a Mack Truck
Y'all ain't never seen this type of action
Police wanna cut us by the fractions
Feed us by the rations
Like a main attraction
Other niggas wanna do the same shit
So I'm so suspicious at the niggas that you came with
I done seen a lot of niggas call
I done seen 'em niggas get ignored
I done seen a shame nigga's fall
Then they get to snitching like a sport
Make a nigga never wanna talk
Probably end up in a cop report
Don't nobody wanna claim they faults
Still want recognition for they heart, dawg
Sympathy for niggas never that though
Although palestan on attack mode
Every other station got an asshole
Lying to the cop
Tryna make it hot
Promise it ain't all about the Blacks tho
Crime's just a crime but the white don't thug right
All because they didn't get into that t-t-thug life
Dirt under the rug type
You know what the gov' like
Chizzy off the drugs, right?
They can't know I'm not high, but

[Chorus]
I want it but
I know they can't handle the truth
Want it but
Know they can't
Handle the truth
Want it but
Know they can't
Can't handle the truth
Want it but
Know they can't

Jack probably bought
Positive these drugs fake
Either that or maybe I should lay up on my intake
Either that or maybe all this weed is just a mistake (must take)
Either that or maybe I'm just cool with what my friends say
Only off uppers, press the MDMA
Brain feels like pasta
Bars feel like penne
No serotonin, depleted my sources
All need some happiness, mine's more important, but
Getting too conscious
Gotta get ignorant
Gotta be honest
Woke up this morning, skyline was sunny
Rolled up five blunts just to keep it a hunnid
Just booked the shoot, bought some coke for the bunnies
Put on my heels, now I'm tall as my money
Tall as my money
Put on my heels, now I'm tall as my money
Tall as it
Tall as it
Lost all my peace when that G coupe got broken
Five words got spoken
Truth just that potent
When my man died I took that as an omen
Funny how niggas was down for a moment
Now they look at me like I'm the opponent
I noticed, I know it
Noticed, I know it"

[Verse 1]
Living life all wrong
'Cause I thought I knew what love was
But my heart, it was made of stone
I was out there seeking after hours for money, looks and power
But all that glows ain't always gold

[Pre-Chorus]
And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing

Living life in darkness, this fight is full of nonsense
Trying to navigate through my mistakes
But ever since I met someone who taught me that love is like a party
I can never dim the lights again

One day, in the year of the fox
Came a time remembered well
When the strong young man
Of the rising sun
Heard the tolling of the great black bell
One day in the year of the fox
When the bell began to ring
It meant the time
Had come for one to go
To the temple of the king

[Chorus]
There in the middle of the circle he stands
Searching, seeking
With just one touch of his trembling hand
The answer will be found
Daylight waits while the old man sings
Heaven help me
And then like the rush of a thousand wings
It shines upon the one
And the day had just begun
(Uh uh uhh...)

There in the middle of the people he stands
Seeing, feeling
With just a wave of a strong right hand, he's gone
To the temple of the king

Far from the circle, at the edge of the world
He's hoping, wondering
Thinking back from the stories he's heard of
What he's gonna see
There, in the middle of a circle it lies
Heaven help me!
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes
The answer had been found

Giving, feeling
With just one touch of a strong right hand, they know
Of the temple and the king

Tempranito se levanta
Justo al cantío de un gallo
Y al toque de mi guitarra

Pá la faena del día

Y antes de coger la calle
Pá casa de sus vecinos
Le pone un vaso de agua
Al ángel de su marido

En el transcurso del día
Saca su pañuelo rojo
Y un poco de agua bendita

Y se te aclara la vista

Todos los males se te quitan

Que el mundo va progresando
Que existe la medicina
Que existen computadoras
Que existe la geografía
Que todo no se resuelve
Bañado en agua bendita

Te diga los buenos días

Each time you fall in love
It's clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn't safe
And each time you kiss a girl
You never know what it's worth
You say all of the words they wanna hear
It isn't real

[Chorus]
She took you for a ride in summer, baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in?

[Verse 2]
Each time you have a dream
You never know what it means
You see that open road and never know which way to go
And each time you fall in love
It's clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A

Something isn't right, I feel it in my bones
Every time I look around, it follows me home
And I get so stressed out with nobody here to listen
When my head gets loud from the weight of this vision

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe & Brian Burkheiser]
All this emptiness inside, I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die, wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head? I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head? I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid

Hear it in the night, in and out of focus

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

[Verse 2]
One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

The world is mine, nigga, get back
Don't fuck with my stack, the gauge is racked
About to drop the bomb, I'm the motherfuckin' don
Big fish in a small pond
Now the feds tryna throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath, they wanna miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything west of the Mississippi
It's the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggas running up on y'all
For the cheese, we want them keys
Everybody freeze, on your knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get heart
Nigga, rewind my part, fool, and

I take ten steps and I draw (

Now who's dissin' the mad-ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple, my mind is ill mental
The Westside Connect's with me and South Central
And a drag from the Zig Zag, can't fuck with the Phillies
Holdin' down the Wild West like a Kid they call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10, the gold crown holder
Strong as a Coca-Cola with a chrome pistola (Brr)
Now who wanna fuss so I can bust when I cuss
My look bring you fear with gear from the Surplus
Since a teen, I chased the green, the crack-scene king
Lolos, Corniches and baguettes on my pieces (Ugh)
So recognize these real G's, chase the cheese
The Westside Connect' keep it rolling like gold D's
Three-wheeling and dealing, it's like the California style
But in the meanwhile, in my town, you got to bow

[Chorus: Mack 10]
(Bow down) When you come to my town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Because I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

Well it's that, Chuck-wearing, still sporting a beanie
The shadiest nigga in the clique, who wanna see me?
As I slide my Locs on, let my khakis hang

Run away, run away, or get your punk ass slayed
By this H double O to the D to the S-T-A (Ah)
Fuck hiding it, I'm gang-related, simple and plain
Which means I could give a fuck about you niggas in this rap game (Ugh)
Flashy niggas get stuck up (Ugh), beat the fuck up (Ugh)
When you come around, keep your chain tucked from this
Zero-zero-apostrophe S shit
Fuck a studio lyricist, I'm real with this (Yes)
Talk the talk, walk the walk
Diss me on wax, I'm tryna saw your whole fucking head off, nigga
I'm platinum bound, so bitch, shut up

Gangstas make the world go round

But if you live on the west side of your town
Make them other fools bow down

And incidents arose from circumstance

[Estribillo: J.I.D]
He tenido tan mala suerte y las cosas no están mejorando
Necesito algo que me lleve más alto
Y tal vez estoy fuera de contacto en un apuro
Y la vida me ha estado pateando el trasero, pero eso encendió el fuego
Y tal vez es cuando estoy derramando mis entrañas
Sé que no confías en mí o no me amas, eres constante, me llamas mentiroso
O tal vez realmente me odias, no puedes ser
Necesito algo que me salve porque, nena, estoy cansado
Si

[Verso 1: J.I.D]
¿Cómo vas a dejarme y luego irte con mi sudadera con mi barrio?
Y no vas a volver, devuélveme mi barrio
Y ahora intentas hacer una escena en el cine
Realmente quieres actuar, perra, estamos en el cine
Quiero que me devuelvan mi dinero, me voy para siempre
Y me pongo nervioso, ni siquiera quiero estar aquí
Y te enojas porque ni siquiera quieres irte de aquí
Y ahora es malo porque ni siquiera hemos visto las vistas previas
Y ahora está enojado, llevandote mierda a las redes sociales
Y solo necesito que me digas cómo te sientes
Y solo necesito que vengas a mí con una mierda real
Molestando a la gente porque peleamos en lo oscuro, sí
No tenemos que irnos, pero vamos a sentarnos en un asiento aparte (Sí)
Uh, lágrimas en el balde de mierda
Peleando y follando y peleando y peleando y follando
Amando, amando a menos que tengas suerte
Te follo porque eres real y eres hermosa
Pero aún así, mirando la pantalla solo pensando en cómo me siento
De verdad
Quiero compartir mis palomitas contigo
Porque no me comeré todo
Pero todavía tienes un problema
Y he estado tratando de beber, conocer al niño del medio
Pero no, se acabó la película, ella solo va al auto
Salió, ella condujo, no abrió la puerta
Muy frío, afuera
Y tu chico necesita un paseo
Oh Dios, es realmente un problema
Y estoy tan cansado

Si, estoy cansado, nena

[Verso 2: 6LACK]
Hey, ¿cómo te vas a ir con tu número en mi factura telefónica? (Factura)
Mira dentro de tu billetera, tienes un billete (Billete)
Nunca conseguí un trabajo pero quieres relajarte (Relajarte)
Chica, esa mierda es irreal (Irreal)
Me siento un poco lento
Crees que estoy entreteniendo toda la basura
Es un ""no"" de mi parte, amigo
Supongo que tengo que dejarte caer libremente
Volteando a través de mi mierda como si estuviéramos en un gimnasio, no
Estoy hablando mi mierda porque estoy fuera de la gallina, amigo
Si yo, uh
No queda nada que admirar
He estado escuchando a Mýa como woah
No dejes que el amor se convierta en Piro
¿Cómo dejas que se prolongue? Espía
Goin 'em en Matt Ryan, espirales
Estoy viendo Z tras Z tras Z
Él, espera, ¿quién está después de mí, huh? (¿Huh?)
Espera, en realidad no expliques nada, no quiero saber
Estoy cansado cada vez que llego a casa
Ella está sola, no es mi culpa
Estoy viviendo la vida, ella está en la oscuridad (Sí, sí)
No tengo mordida, mucho ladrido
Despejo la habitación, para que podamos hablar

Y la vida me ha estado pateando el trasero, pero eso encendió el fuego
Y tal vez es cuando estoy derramando mis entrañas
Sé que no confías en mí o no me amas, eres constante, me llamas mentiroso
O tal vez realmente me odias, no puedes ser
Necesito algo que me salve porque, nena, estoy cansado

[Verso 3: Ella Mai]
Cansada (Cansada)
Ya somos dos
Soy una mentirosa (Mentirosa)
¿Dónde está la verdad en eso?
No puedo entender cómo abres la boca
Has tenido tan mala suerte, y las cosas no están mejorando
Necesitas algo que te lleve más alto
Tal vez estás fuera de contacto en un apuro
Y la vida te ha estado pateando el trasero, pero eso encendió tu fuego
Y cariño, es cuando estás derramando tus tripas
No confías en mí, ámame, llámame mentirosa
Oh cariño, realmente me odias, no puedes ser
Necesitas algo para salvarte
Porque, cariño, estás cansado
Cansado

Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men

So I roll like a stone
Hands up in the air
I don't wanna care
And I'll die with no regrets

[Verse 1]
Friend of mine
I get lost on the highway
The wind keeps taking me one way
They all say I won't be happy where I end up
Love of mine
I got good times in my blood
How many bottles are too much?
They all say I don't know where to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't want to sacrifice the little things
That make life worth living, life worth living

[Chorus]
So I roll like a stone
Hands up in the air (Hey)
I don't wanna care
And I'll die with no regrets
I roll like a stone
Everything I break (Hey)
And all of my mistakes
I can die with no regrets

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
I can die with no regrets
I roll like a stone
Hands up in the air
I don't wanna care
And I'll die with no regrets

[Verse 2]
Friend of mine
We've had heartaches that hurt bad
But no, I won't turn the clock back
'Cause one day we'll know it's a part of the plan, oh
Love of mine
One day the sun will not rise
We don't got time to waste time
So I'm gonna do it while I can

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna sacrifice the little things
That make life worth living, life worth living

[Chorus]
So I roll like a stone

Calling all cars, calling all cars
Be on the lookout for a tall light-skinned brother with dimples
Wearing a black Kangol, sweatsuit, gold chain, and sneakers
Last seen on Farmers Boulevard heading east.
Alias ""LL Cool J"", he's bad
Ahh

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a muscle-bound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last mafioso, I'm an emcee cop
Make you say ""Go LL,"" and do the Wop
If you think you can out-rhyme me, yeah, boy, I bet
'Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter, I'm better, my rhymes are good
I got a gold-made plate that says ""I wish you would""
And when battles begin, then, I gotta join in, and
Before my rhyme is over, you know I'ma win
Cool J has arrived, so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd, they say the kid don't play
Slaughter competition, that's my hobby and job
I don't wear a disguise because I don't owe the mob
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped
So many girls on my jock, I think my phone is tapped, I'm bad

[Refrain: LL Cool J]
Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool-Cool-Cool-Cool-Cool J-J
Cool J, Cool-Cool-Cool-Cool, Cool-Cool-Cool-Cool J, J-J-J, J-J-J-J-J

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I'm like Tyson, ice and I'm a soldier at war
I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more
Got concrete rhymes, been rappin' for ten years
And even when I'm braggin', I'm being sincere
Emcees can't win, I make 'em rust like tin
They call me ""Jaws,"" my hat is like a shark's fin
Because I'm bad as can be, got my voice on wax
Some brothers think he's makin' records, now he must've relaxed
I couldn't and shouldn't, and it'll stay that way
The best rapper you've heard is LL Cool J
Kamikaze, take a look at what I've done
Used to rock in my basement, now I'm number one
And can happen on time, never standing on line
You wanna try me? First, you better learn how to rhyme
I'm the pinnacle; that means I reign supreme
And I'm notorious; I'll crush you like a jellybean, I'm bad

[Interlude: Police]
Suspect was last spotted with three other members of his group
DJ Bobcat and E-Love and then Cut Creator
They are extremely bad, so keep your eyes open
Use extreme caution

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
I eliminate punks, cut 'em up in chunks
You were souped, you heard me and your ego shrunk
I'm devastating, I'm so good it's a shame
'Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal, they call me insane
I'm as strong as a bull, of course you know why I pull
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full
Not Buckaroo Banzai, but bustin' out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make emcees wish that I'd die
Never retire or put my mic on the shelf
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself
Not bitter or mad, just provin' I'm bad
You want a hit? Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad
Emcees retreat 'cause they know I can beat 'em
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em
I'm the baddest, takin' out all rookies
So forget Oreos, eat Cool J cookies, I'm bad

[Refrain: LL Cool J]
Cool J, Cool J (Bob), Cool J (Yo, we get it), Cool J-J-J
Cool J-J, J, Cool, Cool J

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Never ever, no never
Never wearin' no Levis, battle me? Why try?
I'll treat you like a stepchild, so tell mommy, ""Bye, bye""
Slaughterin' emcees and I'ma never get whipped
When I retire, I'll get worshiped like a old battleship
LL, I'm bad, all the rappers know
When I enter the center, they say, ""Yo, yo, there he go""
My paycheck's large, Mr. Bogart in charge
Not a punter or a hunter from a raccoon lodge
The original Todd teachin' how to be hard
Take the skin off a snake and split a pea from a pod
You're a novice, I'm noble and I dissect with my tongue
Not Attila the Hun, Khan or Abdullah Hussein
My vocals exact, like rack and pinion in a Jag
You try to brag, you get your rhymes from a grab-bag
No good scavenger, catfish vulture
My tongue's a chisel and this composition's sculptor, I'm bad

[Outro: Police & LL Cool J]
Think I'm gonna need backup
Think I'm gonna need backup
Give me that walkie-talkie
Yo, this is LL Cool J and you'll never catch me so don't even try it
'Cause I'm too bad for ya, understand?
Ahh
I'm bad"

And I'm protective, it's so cute
But only when it suits you
Is this all in vain?
Can these words explain?

[Chorus]
Desperate minds mean desperate measures
You've got to get this one together
You're young and in love
That should be enough

At least you'll have nice thoughts of me
When I'm cheating on you in your dreams
I told you before, my closet's clean
And that these bones don't belong to me
Try this one for size
Try me one more time
You hold me down
By keeping me around

You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
""I love you"" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but

When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind (Yeah)

When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin', don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind"

Tú tienes algo inusual, que aún no lo descifro
Pero alteras mis sentidos
Otros amores del pasado me han dejado diabética
Y no puedo ser dulce contigo
Le temo a que tú y cupido me vendan un sueño
Y fallar de nuevo
A que hoy estés conmigo y mañana con tu dueña
Si me vuelve a pasar, me muero

Llegando al hotel, sábado en la noche que loquera
Me preguntan señor Reykon que habitación desea
Yo le digo señorita deme la que usted quiera
Al cabo estoy muy loco y me duermo donde sea
No fué mi culpa quedar a su lado
Habitación junta, me incita al pecado
Solo un muro nos tiene separados
Rompo ese hijuep-, y me acuesto a su lado

[Coro: Pipe Calderón]
Yo quiero estar contigo amor
Quiero arrancarte el pantalón
Me desespero pues quiero
Que conmigo pierdas el control
Yo quiero estar contigo amor
Quiero arrancarte el pantalón
Me desespero pues quiero
Que conmigo pierdas el control

[Verso 3: Reykon]
Me le asome sigiloso, paso a paso silencioso
Yo sabía que era peligroso
Y me puse nervioso, hice destrozos
Y esa mujer ahí mismo me pilló

[Puente: Reykon, Pipe Calderón]
Y perdí el control en la habitación
Ella me acorraló y resulta que el gatia'o era yo
Y perdí el control en la habitación
Ella me acorraló y resulta que el gatia'o era yo

[Coro: Reykon, Pipe Calderón]
Yo quiero estar contigo amor
Quiero arrancarte el pantalón
Me desespero pues quiero
Que conmigo pierdas el control
Yo quiero estar contigo amor
Quiero arrancarte el pantalón
Me desespero pues quiero
Que conmigo pierdas el control (El líder)

[Puente: Reykon]
Mientras te gateo y te gateo y te gateo
Mientras te gateo y te gateo y te gateo
Mientras te gateo más te deseo
Yo te gateo y te gateo y te gateo
Mientras te gateo y te gateo y te gateo
Mientras te gateo y te gateo y te gateo
Mientras te gateo más te deseo
Yo te gateo y te gateo y te gateo

[Outro: Reykon, Pipe Calderón]
Bienvenidos a la ciudad de Dios, de Dios
Pipe Calderón con Reykon el líder que no se te olvide
Alexander Dj-D-D-Dj
Y ando con Chez Tom y Chan el genio
Y la Versatilidad no se Aprende se lleva en la Sangre

'Cause I was right there at his graduation
Now, I ain't sayin' that this life don't work
But, it's me and baby that he hurts
Because I tell him right, he thinks I'm wrong
But I love him strong
He gave me the life that I came to live
Gave me the song that I came to give
Pressure on me, but the seed has grown
I can't make it on my own

He became the sun, I became the moon

[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
No

[Verso 1]
Entre tanta gente yo te vi llegar
Algo en el destino me hizo saludar
Te dije mi nombre y no sé dónde
Como con un beso me respondes
Sólo te importó que te tratara bien
Tú de 19 y yo de 23
Y empecé mis planes para vernos otra vez
Y si pudiera mostrarte
Que estando juntos ya no hay nada que falte
Y que a pesar de la distancia te voy a querer
Sólo tienes que saber
Que yo quisiera quedarme
Y aunque no debo, sólo quiero llamarte
Que repitamos las historias una y otra vez, no sé

[Coro]
¿Cómo te pido que te enamores?
Cuando al final no voy a estar cuando tú llores
¿Cómo te pido que te ilusiones?
Y recortar nuestra distancia con canciones
¿Cómo te pido? Si al final no voy a estar
Cuando de ti me enamore
Cuando de ti me enamore, uh

[Verso 2]
Recuerdo todo lo que te gustaba
Y tu camisa que llega a los pies
Esa carita cuando te cantaba por primera vez
Me llevo todo y no me llevo nada
Sin ti no hay nada, todo te dejé
Sé que es muy pronto para estas palabras, pero las diré
Como tu mano y mi mano en la noche no sienten frío
Sin ti las horas se pasan, pero con días vacíos
Como en Marbella las olas, tú estabas bella y a solas
Y yo te extraño y te extraño, pero te llamo y lo olvido
Como te quiero y te quiero, pero este amor ya no es mío
Sé que tu boca y mi boca cuando se juntan hay lío
Cómo quisiera quedarme, pero ahora no estás conmigo
Siempre la vida se pasa, pero no pasa contigo

[Coro]
¿Cómo te pido que te enamores?
Cuando al final no voy a estar cuando tú llores
¿Cómo te pido que te ilusiones?
Y recortar nuestra distancia con canciones
¿Cómo te pido? Si al final no voy a estar
Cuando de ti me enamore (Tú de 19 y yo de 23)
Cuando de ti me enamore (Tú de 19 y yo de 23)

[Outro]
Y aunque yo esté en otra parte
Soy más feliz porque yo pude encontrarte
Y aunque no tenga la certeza de volverte a ver
Es tuya esta canción
Recuérdame"

Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain, spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard, catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, and to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do

[Verse 2]
Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

[Chorus]
To be yourself is all that you can do (
All that you can do

And even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of the good or bad
Faces of luck, don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose

[Pre-Chorus]
But to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah
To be yourself is all that you can do, oh

To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh

Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket, on truth devoured
A silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes, a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All thе Fistagons, the bullets, and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff thе party ranks
More for Gore, or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!
